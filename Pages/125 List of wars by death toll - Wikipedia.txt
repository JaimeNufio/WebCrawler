this list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
this section may require cleanup to meet wikipedia's quality standards. the specific problem is: limit to wars under a single leader or ruler, it is impossible to objectively compare 500 years of intermittent warfare with a given military campaign. please help improve this section if you can. (may 2018) (learn how and when to remove this template message)
note: the identity of a single "war" cannot be reliably given in some cases, and some "wars" can be taken to last over more than a human lifetime,  e.g.
"reconquista" (711–1492, 781 years)
"muslim conquests in india" (12th to 16th c., 500 years)
"crusades" (ten or more campaigns during the period 1095–1291, 196 years),
"mongol conquests" (1206–1368, 162 years),
"early muslim conquests" (622–750, 128 years),
"hundred years' war" (1337–1453, 115 years).

mythology of italy refers to the mythology of people living in italy.
important gods and goddesses of italian mythology:

anteros is the italian god of love and passion. specifically, anteros was the god of mutual love and would punish those who did not return love.
aradia is the italian witch goddess. she protects women against the aggression of masculine faith and symbolizes the air element and the moon.
carmenta is the goddess of spells, known for chanting incantations in verse to ease the pains of women in labor and children facing illness.
februus is the italian god of purification who lives in the underworld.
fortuna is the goddess of fate and fortune and also bringer of fertility.
jana is the goddess of the moon, said to have 2 faces, one facing the past one facing the future.
jove is the sky god. he is the equivalent of jupiter of roman mythology who is the king of all other gods.
nox is the goddess of the night, believed that all things had their beginning from her, and that she is one of the oldest of the gods.
umbria is goddess of shadows, secrets, darkness who lives in the underworld.
malocchio or the evil eye
the evil eye is not just an italian folklore but is present in many different cultures. each of these cultures have their own versions of the evil eye. however, the evil eye is very prominent in italian culture and still a common superstition today among italians and italian-americans. 
the evil eye is a look one gives another to put bad luck upon them either causing them misfortune or causing a type of mild physical pain.this look is cast by someone typically because of jealousy and envy.
however italian culture has two ways to counteract the evil eye. these are the italian horn, or the “cornuto” and the “mano carnuto”, the hand horn. the italian horn is a pendant often worn on a necklace in a shape similar to a chili pepper. this pendant is often in gold or coral and is said to be sacred to the moon goddess. this is meant to ward off evil spirits as well. the “mano carnuto” is the formation of a hand in a fist with the pinky finger and index finger extended. this is also supposed to ward of negative vibes and the evil eye. both of these counteractions are of italian origins.

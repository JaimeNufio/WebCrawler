two of the five 'monuments', the oldest and most prestigious one-day races on the cycling calendar, are located in italy: milan–san remo, held in march, and giro di lombardia, held in september or october.

basketball[edit]
 the italian standout player, andrea bargnani, played with the toronto raptors in the nba.
italy is one of the main basketball nations in europe, along with spain, serbia, greece, slovenia, lithuania, croatia, russia, turkey, and france. it has a long and rich tradition in the sport. the italian national basketball team's best results were gold at eurobasket 1983 and eurobasket 1999, as well as silver at the olympics in 1980 and 2004. until the 2000s, the italian league was considered the strongest domestic league outside of north america. it has recently been overtaken by the spanish acb, but is still one of the top leagues in europe, along with the vtb united league in russia with teams in other nearby nations, the greek basket league, the adriatic league, and the baltic league. famous club teams include olimpia milano, virtus bologna, pallacanestro varese, pallacanestro cantù, fortitudo bologna, scavolini pesaro, benetton treviso, montepaschi siena, basket napoli, virtus roma, pallacanestro trieste, and juvecaserta basket.

rugby union[edit]
main article: rugby union in italy
 the stadio flaminio during a rugby union match in the 2011 six nations championship, between italy and france, which resulted in an upset victory for italy.
rugby union enjoys a good level of popularity, especially in the north of the country. from the 2010–11 season, italy has had two teams in the pro12, previously an all-celtic competition, involving teams from ireland, scotland, and wales. to accommodate this move, the country's national championship of excellence effectively became a semi-professional developmental competition. the two pro12 sides took up italy's existing places in the elite europe-wide club competition, then known as the heineken cup and now as the european rugby champions cup, and four eccellenza sides compete in the second-tier european rugby challenge cup. italy's national team competes in the six nations championship, and is a regular at the rugby world cup. italy are classed as a tier-one nation by world rugby.
rugby union in italy goes back around a century, and it has been established that british communities brought rugby to genoa, between 1890 and 1895, with other confirmations of games in italy around 1909. the society that organised the first games did not survive long and dissolved soon after them.
rugby union's traditional heartland consisted of the small country towns in the po valley, and other parts of northern italy.[2] one version says that italian workers returning from france, particularly the south, introduced the game there, and gave it a significant rural/working class base, which still exists in towns such as treviso and rovigo.[2] a demonstration game was also played in 1910, in turin between racing club paris and servette of geneva. french students also introduced the game to milan university c. 1911. while each of these events has been hailed as the "origin of italian rugby", it seems that they probably happened more or less simultaneously and independent of one another, and that the introduction of rugby to italy was a series of events, rather than a single starting point. whatever the ultimate origins of the game in northern italy, the region's proximity to the french rugby heartland helped as well.

skiing[edit]

see also: italy national alpine ski team
alpine skiing or ski (sci) is a very popular sport in italy, with more than 2,000,000 skiers, most of them in the northern regions near the alps and in the central provinces near the apennine mountains. italian skiers have achieved good results in the winter olympic games, world cup, and world championship, most notably zeno colò, gustavo thoeni, who won 4 overall world cups between 1970 and 1975; piero gros, who was overall world cup champion in 1974, and alberto tomba who won the overall world cup in 1995. tomba, deborah compagnoni, and isolde kostner received many medals in different editions of the winter olympic games. giorgio rocca and manfred mölgg won the slalom world cup in 2006 and 2008 respectively, whilst giuliano razzoli was olympic slalom champion in 2010.

tennis has a significant following near courts and by television. italian professional tennis players are always in the top 100 world's ranking of male and female players. beach tennis with paddle racquet was invented by italians, and is practiced by many people across the country. italy won the davis cup in 1976 and the fed cup in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013. italian players such as sara errani, flavia pennetta, roberta vinci and francesca schiavone have entered the wta top 10 in their careers. schiavone was the first italian player to win a grand slam singles title, winning the 2010 french open; she was later followed by pennetta, who won the 2015 us open. the doubles duo of sara errani and roberta vinci have accomplished a career grand slam in doubles, have been named itf world champions 3 years in a row (2012, 2013, 2014) and have ended every season since 2012 as world no. 1.

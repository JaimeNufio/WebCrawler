history[edit]
the fortress of chelyaba, from which the city takes its name, was founded at the location of the bashkir village of chelyaby (bashkir: силәбе, siläbe) by colonel alexey (kutlu-muhammed) tevkelev in 1736[2] to protect the surrounding trade routes from possible attacks by bashkir outlaws. during pugachev's rebellion, the fortress withstood a siege by the rebel forces in 1774, but was eventually captured for several months in 1775. in 1782, as a part of ufa viceroyalty that was later reformed into orenburg governorate, chelyabinsk became a seat of a its own uyezd and finally was granted town status and its current name in 1787.

 tea-packing factory kuznetsov (1898)
 trading house negotiant valeyev (1911)
until the late 19th century, chelyabinsk was a small provincial town. in 1892, the samara-zlatoust railway was completed which connected it with moscow and the rest of european russia. also in 1892, construction of the trans-siberian railway from chelyabinsk started and in 1896 the city was linked to ekaterinburg. chelyabinsk became the hub for relocation to siberia. for fifteen years more than fifteen million people - a tenth of russia - passed through chelyabinsk. some of them remained in chelyabinsk, which contributed to its rapid growth. in addition, in chelyabinsk was organized custom office set "customs fracture" the bounding duty-free grain and tea to the european part of the country that led to the emergence in mills and set the tea-packing factory. soon chelyabinsk started turning into a major trade center, its population reached 20,000 inhabitants by 1897, 45,000 by 1913, and 70,000 by 1917. for rapid growth at the turn of the 20th century, similar to american cities, chelyabinsk called "behind the urals chicago".[14]
during the first five-year plans of the 1930s, chelyabinsk experienced rapid industrial growth. several establishments, including the chelyabinsk tractor plant and the chelyabinsk metallurgical plant, were built at this time. during world war ii, joseph stalin decided to move a large part of soviet factory production to places out of the way of the advancing german armies in late 1941. this brought new industries and thousands of workers to chelyabinsk. facilities for the production of t-34 tanks and katyusha rocket launchers existed in chelyabinsk. during world war ii, it produced 18,000 tanks, and 48,500 tank diesel engines as well as over 17 million units of ammunition. in the press of the time chelyabinsk was informally called "tankograd" or "tank city". the s.m. kirov factory no. 185 moved here from leningrad to produce heavy tanks; it was transferred to omsk after 1962.

2013 meteor[edit]
main article: chelyabinsk meteor
shortly after dawn on february 15, 2013, a superbolide meteor descended at over 55,000 kilometers per hour (34,000 mph) over the ural mountains, exploding at an altitude of 25–30 kilometers (16–19 mi).[15][dubious  – discuss]
the meteor created a momentary flash as bright as the sun and generated a shock wave that injured over a thousand people. fragments fell in and around chelyabinsk. interior ministry spokesman vadim kolesnikov said 1,100 people had called for medical assistance following the incident, mostly for treatment of injuries from glass broken by the explosions. one woman suffered a broken spine.[16] kolesnikov also said about 600 square meters (6,000 sq ft) of a roof at a zinc factory had collapsed. a spokeswoman for the emergency ministry told the associated press that there was a meteor shower; however, another ministry spokeswoman was quoted by the interfax news agency as saying it was a single meteor.[17][18][19] the size has been estimated at 17 meters (56 ft) diameter with a mass of 10,000[20][21] or 11,000[22] metric tons. the power of the explosion was about 500 kilotons of tnt (about 1.8 pj), which is 20–30 times more energy than was released from the atomic bomb exploded in hiroshima. luckily, thanks to the high altitude of the explosion the city managed to avoid large casualties and destruction.

administrative and municipal status[edit]
 the building of the legislative assembly of chelyabinsk oblast
chelyabinsk is the administrative center of the oblast.[1] within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of chelyabinsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.[1] as a municipal division, the city of chelyabinsk is incorporated as chelyabinsky urban okrug.[1] in june 2014, chelyabinsk's seven city districts were granted municipal status.[23]

geography[edit]
chelyabinsk is located east of the ural mountains, 199 km south of yekaterinburg.
its elevation is 200–250 meters.
the city is bisected by the river miass which is regarded as the border between the urals and siberia. this is reflected in the geology of the place, with low granite hills of the urals on the western side and lower sedimentary rock of the west siberian plain on the eastern side.
the "leningrad bridge" connects the two sides, so it is called the "bridge of the urals to siberia". chelyabinsk itself is therefore also known as "the gateway to siberia".[24]
like rome, constantinople, and moscow, chelyabinsk is said to be located on seven hills.[25]

climate[edit]
the city has a warm summer humid continental climate (köppen: dfb) farther north than found on canadian prairies. the average temperature in january is well below the freezing point (-14°c/6.6 °f), but july has a relatively cool average (19°c/66.7 °f), and the annual average is a few degrees above zero celsius (3°c/37.8 °f), indicating still some moderation. the range of extremes reaches 70°c/158 °f, typical of a mid-latitude climate on a large continent such as eurasia.[26]
the highest precipitation is concentrated in the summer, reducing in the winter. july, month with higher precipitation is 87mm/3.44'' and january, driest month is 15mm/0.6''. altogether they are 16.9" of annual precipitation and therefore approaching with a semi-arid climate. it is 119 rainy days a year, but the first month of the year records only one tenth of a day.[26]

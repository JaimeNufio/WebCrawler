the anti-nuclear movement is a social movement that opposes various nuclear technologies. some direct action groups, environmental movements, and professional organisations have identified themselves with the movement at the local, national, or international level.[2][3] major anti-nuclear groups include campaign for nuclear disarmament, friends of the earth, greenpeace, international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war, peace action and the nuclear information and resource service. the initial objective of the movement was nuclear disarmament, though since the late 1960s opposition has included the use of nuclear power. many anti-nuclear groups oppose both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. the formation of green parties in the 1970s and 1980s was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics.[4]
scientists and diplomats have debated nuclear weapons policy since before the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945.[5] the public became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the pacific. in 1963, many countries ratified the partial test ban treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing.[6]
some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s,[7] and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.[8] in the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in wyhl, west germany. the project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of europe and north america.[9][10] nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s[11] and while opposition to nuclear power continues, increasing public support for nuclear power has re-emerged over the last decade in light of growing awareness of global warming and renewed interest in all types of clean energy (see the pro-nuclear movement).
a protest against nuclear power occurred in july 1977 in bilbao, spain, with up to 200,000 people in attendance. following the three mile island accident in 1979, an anti-nuclear protest was held in new york city, involving 200,000 people. in 1981, germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the brokdorf nuclear power plant west of hamburg; some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. the largest protest was held on june 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in new york city against nuclear weapons.  a 1983 nuclear weapons protest in west berlin had about 600,000 participants. in may 1986, following the chernobyl disaster, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in rome to protest against the italian nuclear program. in the us, public opposition preceded the shutdown of the shoreham, yankee rowe, millstone 1, rancho seco, maine yankee, and many other nuclear power plants.
for many years after the 1986 chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. in the 2000s (decade), however, following public relations activities by the nuclear industry,[12][13][14][15][16] advances in nuclear reactor designs, and concerns about climate change, nuclear power issues came back into energy policy discussions in some countries. the 2011 japanese nuclear accidents subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed renaissance and revived nuclear opposition worldwide, putting governments on the defensive.[17] as of 2016, countries such as australia, austria, denmark, greece, malaysia, new zealand, and norway have no nuclear power stations and remain opposed to nuclear power.[18][19] germany, italy, spain, and switzerland are phasing-out nuclear power[1] sweden formerly had a nuclear phase-out policy, aiming to end nuclear power generation in sweden by 2010. on 5 february 2009, the government of sweden announced an agreement allowing for the replacement of existing reactors, effectively ending the phase-out policy.[19][20][21][22]
globally, more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years.[21]

history and issues[edit]
roots of the movement[edit]

main article: history of the anti-nuclear movement
 worldwide nuclear testing totals, 1945–1998
the application of nuclear technology, as a source of energy and as an instrument of war, has been controversial.[23][24][25][26][27][28] these issues are discussed in nuclear weapons debate, nuclear power debate, and uranium mining debate.
scientists and diplomats have debated nuclear weapons policy since before the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945.[5] the public became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the pacific. in 1961, at the height of the cold war, about 50,000 women brought together by women strike for peace marched in 60 cities in the united states to demonstrate against nuclear weapons.[29][30] in 1963, many countries ratified the partial test ban treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing.[6]
some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s,[7] and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.[8] in the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in wyhl, germany. the project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of europe and north america.[9][10] nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.[11]

concerns about nuclear weapons[edit]
 the 18,000 km2 expanse of the semipalatinsk test site (indicated in red), which covers an area the size of wales. the soviet union conducted 456 nuclear tests at semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989 with little regard for their effect on the local people or environment. the full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by soviet authorities and has only come to light since the test site closed in 1991.[31]

from an anti-nuclear point of view, there is a threat to modern civilization from global nuclear war by accidental or deliberate nuclear strike.[32] some climate scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions from climatic effects alone and disabled future generation
. soot thrown up into the atmosphere could blanket the earth, causing food chain disruption in what is termed a nuclear winter.[33][34]
many anti-nuclear weapons groups cite the 1996 advisory opinion of the international court of justice, legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons, in which it found that 'the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict'.[35]
ridding the world of nuclear weapons has been a cause for pacifists for decades. but more recently mainstream politicians and retired military leaders have advocated nuclear disarmament. in january 2007 an article in the wall street journal, authored by henry kissinger, bill perry, george shultz and sam nunn.[36] these men were veterans of the cold-war who believed in using nuclear weapons for deterrence. but they now reversed their previous position and asserted that instead of making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme concern.[37]
since the 1970s, some countries have built their own second-strike capability of massive deterrence in the event of a military attack with weapons of mass destruction. 
two examples of this second-strike capability are the samson option strategy of israel, and the dead hand system of russia.
during the era of nuclear weapons testing many local communities were affected, and some are still affected by uranium mining, and radioactive waste disposal.[32]

concerns about nuclear power[edit]
 following the 2011 japanese fukushima nuclear disaster, authorities shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants. as of 2013, the fukushima site remains highly radioactive, with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some land will be unfarmable for centuries. the difficult cleanup job will take 40 or more years, and cost tens of billions of dollars.[38][39]

there are large variations in peoples’ understanding of the issues surrounding nuclear power, including the technology itself, its deployment, climate change, and energy security. there is a wide spectrum of views and concerns over nuclear power[40] and it remains a controversial area of public policy.[41]
many studies have shown that the public "perceives nuclear power as a very risky technology" and, around the world, nuclear energy has declined in popularity since the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster.[42][43][44] anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity.[45] opponents of nuclear power have raised a number of related concerns:[46]

nuclear accidents: a concern that the core of a nuclear power plant could overheat and melt down, releasing radioactivity.
radioactive waste disposal: a concern that nuclear power results in large amounts of radioactive waste, some of which remains dangerous for very long periods.
nuclear proliferation: a concern that some types of nuclear reactor designs use and/or produce  fissile material which could be used in nuclear weapons.
high cost: a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive.
attacks on nuclear plants: a concern that nuclear facilities could be targeted by terrorists or criminals.
curtailed civil liberties: a concern that the risk of nuclear accidents, proliferation and terrorism may be used to justify restraints on citizen rights.
of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive waste have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide.[46] anti-nuclear campaigners point to the 2011 fukushima nuclear emergency as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe.[47]
in his book global fission: the battle over nuclear power, jim falk  explores connections between technological concerns and political concerns. falk suggests that concerns of citizen groups or individuals who oppose nuclear power have often focused initially on the "range of physical hazards which accompany the technology" and leads to a "concern over the political relations of the nuclear industry" a more neutral observer might observe that this is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. baruch fischhoff, a social science professor said that many people really do not trust the nuclear industry.[48] wade allison, a physics professor actually says "radiation is safe & all nations should embrace nuclear technology"[49]
m.v. ramana says that "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy is widespread", and a 2001 survey by the european commission found that "only 10.1 percent of europeans trusted the nuclear industry". this public distrust is periodically reinforced by nuclear safety violations, or through ineffectiveness or corruption of the nuclear regulatory authorities. once lost, says ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain.[50]
faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of  numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern. m.v. ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful.[51] nuclear proponents have tried to regain public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. these designs include those that  incorporate passive safety and small modular reactors. while these reactor designs "are intended to inspire trust, they may have an unintended effect: creating distrust of older reactors that lack the touted safety features".[52]
since 2000 the nuclear industry has undertaken an international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power as a solution to the greenhouse effect and climate change.[53] nuclear power, the industry says, emits no or negligible amounts of carbon dioxide. anti-nuclear groups respond by saying that only reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide emissions. all other stages of the nuclear fuel chain – mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management – use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide.[53][54][55]
in 2011, a french court fined électricité de france (edf) €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on greenpeace, including hacking into greenpeace's computer systems. greenpeace was awarded €500,000 in damages.[56][57]
there is a wide range of published energy-related studies which conclude that energy efficiency programs and renewable power technologies are a better energy option than nuclear power plants. this diverse range of studies come from many different sources, across the political spectrum, and from various academic disciplines, which suggests that there is a consensus among many independent, non-partisan energy experts that nuclear power plants are a poor way to produce electrical power.[58]

other technologies[edit]
 protest against iter in france, 2009
the international nuclear fusion project international thermonuclear experimental reactor (iter) is constructing the world's largest and most advanced experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor in the south of france. a collaboration between the european union (eu), india, japan, china, russia, south korea and the united states, the project aims to make a transition from experimental studies of plasma physics to electricity-producing fusion power plants. in 2005, greenpeace international issued a press statement criticizing government funding of the iter, believing the money should have been diverted to renewable energy sources and claiming that fusion energy would result in nuclear waste and nuclear weapons proliferation issues. a french association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, sortir du nucléaire (get out of nuclear energy), claimed that iter was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium hydrogen isotopes used in the fusion process.[59] according to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear fusion power “remains a distant dream”.[60]  the world nuclear association have said that fusion "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges".[61] construction of the iter facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns. several milestones of the project has already been finished, but the finishing date for first plasma has been discussed and postponed many times with various conclusions. in late 2016, the iter council agreed on an updated project schedule, with a planned first plasma opening by 2025, nine years after the originally anticipated opening.[62][63]
some anti-nuclear groups advocate reduced reliance on reactor-produced medical radioisotopes, through the use of alternative radioisotope production and alternative clinical technologies.[64] cyclotrons are being increasingly used to produce medical radioisotopes to the point where nuclear reactors are no longer needed to make the most common medical isotopes.[65]

nuclear-free alternatives[edit]
see also: 100% renewable energy, soft energy path, renewable energy commercialisation, non-nuclear future, and clean tech nation
 three renewable energy sources: solar energy, wind power, and hydroelectricity
 the 150 mw andasol solar power station is a commercial parabolic trough solar thermal power plant, located in spain. the andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isn't shining.[66]
 photovoltaic sudi shade is an autonomous and mobile station in france that provides energy for electric vehicles using solar energy.
anti-nuclear groups say that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting energy conservation and energy efficiency measures. energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption while providing the same level of energy "services".[67]
renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight, wind, tides, plant growth, and geothermal heat, as the international energy agency explains:[68]

.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. in its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources.

anti-nuclear groups also favour the use of renewable energy, such as hydro, wind power, solar power, geothermal energy and biofuel.[69] according to the international energy agency renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to world energy security and provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases.[70] fossil fuels are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy. according to lester r. brown:


...the transition from coal, oil, and gas to wind, solar, and geothermal energy is well under way. in the old economy, energy was produced by burning something — oil, coal, or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy. the new energy economy harnesses the energy in wind, the energy coming from the sun, and heat from within the earth itself.[71]


in 2014 global wind power capacity expanded 16% to 369,553 mw.[72] yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage,[73] 11.4% in the eu,[74] and it is widely used in asia, and the united states. in 2014, worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 177 gigawatts (gw), sufficient to supply 1 percent of global electricity demands.[75] solar thermal energy stations operate in the united states and spain, and as of 2016, the largest of these is the 392 mw ivanpah solar electric generating system in california.[76][77] the world's largest geothermal power installation is the geysers in california, with a rated capacity of 750 mw. brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel. ethanol fuel is also widely available in the united states.
greenpeace advocates a reduction of fossil fuels by 50% by 2050 as well as phasing out nuclear power, contending that innovative technologies can increase energy efficiency, and suggests that by 2050 most electricity will come from renewable sources.[69] the international energy agency estimates that nearly 50% of global electricity supplies will need to come from renewable energy sources in order to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and minimise climate change impacts.[78]
mark z. jacobson, a stanford professor, says producing all new energy with wind power, solar power,  and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.[79]  many has since referred to jacobson's work to justify advocating for all 100% renewables, however, in february, 2017, a group of twenty-one scientists published a critique of jacobson's work and found that his analysis involves "errors, inappropriate methods and implausible assumptions" and failed to provide "credible evidence for rejecting the conclusions of previous analyses that point to the benefits of considering a broad portfolio of energy system options."[80]

anti-nuclear organizations[edit]

 members of nevada desert experience hold a prayer vigil during the easter period of 1982 at the entrance to the nevada test site.
the anti-nuclear movement is a social movement which operates at the local, national, and international level. various types of groups have identified themselves with the movement:[3]

direct action groups, such as the clamshell alliance and shad alliance
environmental groups, such as friends of the earth and greenpeace
consumer protection groups, such as ralph nader's critical mass
professional organisations,[2] such as international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war
political parties such as european free alliance
anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public protests and acts of civil disobedience which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government authorities, influencing public policy through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections. anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licensing proceedings.[81]
anti-nuclear power organisations have emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme. protest movements against nuclear power first emerged in the united states, at the local level, and spread quickly to europe and the rest of the world. national nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. fuelled by the three mile island accident and the chernobyl disaster, the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years "made nuclear energy untenable in many countries".[82] in the 1970s and 1980s, the formation of green parties was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics (e.g., in germany and sweden).[4]
some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on nuclear power and energy issues.[83] in 1992, the chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission said that "his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups".[84]

international organizations[edit]
european nuclear disarmament, which held annual conventions in the 1980s involving thousands of anti-nuclear weapons activists mostly from western europe but also from eastern europe, the united states, and australia.[85]
friends of the earth international, a network of environmental organizations in 77 countries.[86] since 2014, however, foe (uk) has softened its stance; the fierce opposition against nuclear reactors has shifted into a more pragmatic opposition, which still opposes the construction of new nuclear (fission) reactors, but doesn't campaign against closing down the existing ones any more.[87]

 demonstration in lyon, france in the 1980s against nuclear tests
 on 12 december 1982, 30,000 women held hands around the 6 miles (9.7 km) perimeter of the base, in protest against the decision to site american cruise missiles there.
main article: anti-nuclear protests
in 1971, the town of wyhl, in germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. in the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue.  in 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant.[9][10][96] the wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites.[9]
in 1972, the nuclear disarmament movement maintained a presence in the pacific, largely in response to french nuclear testing there. new zealand activists sailed boats into the test zone, interrupting the testing program.[97][98] in australia, thousands of people joined protest marches in adelaide, melbourne, brisbane, and sydney. scientists issued statements demanding an end to the nuclear tests. in fiji, anti-nuclear activists formed an against testing on mururoa organization.[98]
in the basque country (spain and france), a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately led to the abandonment of most of the planned nuclear power projects.[99] on july 14, 1977, in bilbao, between 150,000 and 200,000 people protested against the lemoniz nuclear power plant. this has been called the "biggest ever anti-nuclear demonstration".[100]
in france, there were mass protests in the early 1970s, organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in france. between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations.[1] in 1977 there was a massive demonstration at the superphénix breeder reactor in creys-malvillein which culminated in violence.[101]
in west germany, between february 1975 and april 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. several site occupations were also attempted. following the three mile island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in bonn.[1]
in the philippines, there were many protests in the late 1970s and 1980s against the proposed bataan nuclear power plant, which was built but never operated.[102]

the anti-nuclear organisation "nevada semipalatinsk" was formed in 1989 and was one of the first major anti-nuclear groups in the former soviet union.  it attracted thousands of people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the nuclear test site in north-east kazakhstan, in 1991.[110][111][112][113]
the world uranium hearing was held in salzburg, austria in september 1992. anti-nuclear speakers from all continents, including indigenous speakers and scientists, testified to the health and environmental problems of uranium mining and processing, nuclear power, nuclear weapons, nuclear tests, and radioactive waste disposal. people who spoke at the 1992 hearing included: thomas banyacya, katsumi furitsu, manuel pino and floyd red crow westerman.[114][115]

recent developments[edit]
for many years after the 1986 chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. in the 2000s (decade), however, following public relations activities by the nuclear industry,[14][15][16][134] advances in nuclear reactor designs, and concerns about climate change, nuclear power issues came back into energy policy discussions in some countries. the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed come back.[17]

2004–2006
in january 2004, up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in paris against a new generation of nuclear reactors, the european pressurised water reactor (epwr).[135]
on may 1, 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched past the united nations in new york, 60 years after the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki.[127][128] this was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the u.s. for several decades.[136] in britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging trident weapons system with a newer model. the largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of the public opposed the move.[136]

a convoy of 350 farm tractors and 50,000 protesters took part in an anti-nuclear rally in berlin on september 5, 2009.  the marchers demanded that germany close all nuclear plants by 2020 and close the gorleben radioactive dump.[150][151] gorleben is the focus of the anti-nuclear movement in germany, which has tried to derail train transports of waste and to destroy or block the approach roads to the site. two above-ground storage units house 3,500 containers of radioactive sludge and thousands of tonnes of spent fuel rods.[152]

2010
 kettenreaktion! in uetersen, germany
on april 21, 2010, a dozen environmental organizations called on the united states nuclear regulatory commission to investigate possible limitations in the ap1000 reactor design. these groups appealed to three federal agencies to suspend the licensing process because they believed containment in the new design is weaker than existing reactors.[153]
on april 24, 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (kettenreaktion!) between the nuclear plants at krümmel and brunsbüttel. in this way they were demonstrating against the plans of the german government to extend the life of nuclear power reactors.[154]

tens of thousands of people marched in central tokyo in september 2011, chanting "sayonara nuclear power" and waving banners, to call on japan's government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the fukushima nuclear disaster. author kenzaburō ōe and musician ryuichi sakamoto were among the event's supporters.[181]
since the march 2011 japanese fukushima nuclear disaster, "populations around proposed indian npp sites have launched protests that are now finding resonance around the country, raising questions about atomic energy as a clean and safe alternative to fossil fuels".[182] assurances by prime minister manmohan singh that all safety measures will be implemented, have not been heeded, and there have thus been mass protests against the french-backed 9900 mw jaitapur nuclear power project in maharashtra and the 2000 mw koodankulam nuclear power plant in tamil nadu. the state government of west bengal state has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 mw facility where six russian reactors were to be built.[182] a public interest litigation (pil) has also been filed against the government’s civil nuclear program at the apex supreme court. the pil specifically asks for the "staying of all proposed nuclear power plants till satisfactory safety measures and cost-benefit analyses are completed by independent agencies".[182][183]
michael banach, the current vatican representative to the international atomic energy agency, told a conference in vienna in september 2011 that the japanese nuclear disaster created new concerns about the safety of nuclear plants globally. auxiliary bishop of osaka michael goro matsuura said this serious nuclear power incident should be a lesson for japan and other countries to abandon nuclear projects. he called on the worldwide christian solidarity to provide wide support for this anti-nuclear campaign. statements from bishops’ conferences in korea and the philippines called on their governments to abandon atomic power. nobel laureate kenzaburō ōe has said japan should decide quickly to abandon its nuclear reactors.[184]

casualties[edit]
 anti-nuclear demonstrations near gorleben, lower saxony, germany, 8 may 1996
casualties during anti-nuclear protests include:

on 9 december 1982, norman mayer, an american anti–nuclear weapons activist, was shot and killed by the united states park police after threatening to blow up the washington monument, washington, d.c., unless a national dialogue on the threat of nuclear weapons was seriously undertaken.
on 10 july 1985, the flagship of greenpeace, rainbow warrior, was sunk by french agents in new zealand waters, and a greenpeace photographer was killed. the ship was involved in protests against nuclear weapons testing at mururoa atoll. the french government initially denied any involvement with the sinking but eventually admitted its guilt in october 1985. two french agents pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter, and the french government paid $7 million in damages.[203]
in 1990, two pylons holding high-voltage power lines connecting the french and italian grid were blown up by italian eco-terrorists, and the attack is believed to have been directly in opposition against the superphénix.[204]

impact on popular culture[edit]
see also: list of films about nuclear issues
 montage of film stills from the international uranium film festival
beginning in the 1950s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as fail-safe and feature films such as godzilla (1954),dr. strangelove or: how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb (1964), the china syndrome (1979), silkwood (1983), and the rainbow warrior (1992).
dr. strangelove explored "what might happen within the pentagon ... if some maniac air force general should suddenly order a nuclear attack on the soviet union". one reviewer called the movie "one of the cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been on the screen".[206]
the china syndrome has been described as a "gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power" which had an extra impact when the real-life accident at the three mile island nuclear plant occurred several weeks after the film opened. jane fonda plays a tv reporter who witnesses a near-meltdown (the "china syndrome" of the title) at a local nuclear plant, which was averted by a quick-thinking engineer, played by jack lemmon. the plot suggests that corporate greed and cost-cutting "have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction".[207]
silkwood was inspired by the true-life story of karen silkwood, who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the kerr-mcgee plutonium plant where she worked.[25]
dark circle is a 1982 american documentary film that focuses on the connections between the nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industries, with a strong emphasis on the individual human and protracted u.s. environmental costs involved.  a clear point made by the film is that while only two bombs were dropped on japan, many hundreds were exploded in the united states. the film won the grand prize for documentary at the sundance film festival and received a national emmy award for "outstanding individual achievement in news and documentary."[208] for the opening scenes and about half of its length, the film focuses on the rocky flats plant and its plutonium contamination of the area's environment.
ashes to honey (ミツバチの羽音と地球の回転, mitsubashi no haoto to chikyū no kaiten), (literally "humming of bees and rotation of the earth") is a japanese documentary directed by hitomi kamanaka and released in 2010.[209] it is the third in kamanaka's trilogy of films on the problems of nuclear power and radiation, preceded by hibakusha at the end of the world (also known as radiation: a slow death) and rokkasho rhapsody.[210]
nuclear tipping point is a 2010 documentary film produced by the nuclear threat initiative. it features interviews with four american government officials who were in office during the cold war period, but are now advocating for the elimination of nuclear weapons. they are: henry kissinger, george shultz, sam nunn, and william perry.[211]
musicians united for safe energy (muse) was a musical group founded in 1979 by jackson browne, graham nash, bonnie raitt, and john hall, following the three mile island nuclear accident.  the group organized a series of five no nukes concerts held at madison square garden in new york city in september 1979.  on september 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large anti-nuclear rally staged by muse on the then-empty north end of the battery park city landfill in new york.[118] the album no nukes, and a film, also titled no nukes, were both released in 1980 to document the performances.
in 2007, bonnie raitt, graham nash, and jackson browne, as part of the no nukes group, recorded a music video of the buffalo springfield song "for what it's worth".[212][213]

the bulletin of the atomic scientists is a nontechnical online magazine that has been published continuously since 1945, when it was founded by former manhattan project physicists after the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki. the bulletin's primary aim is to inform the public about nuclear policy debates while advocating for the international control of nuclear weapons. one of the driving forces behind the creation of the bulletin was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy at the dawn of the atomic age. in 1945 the public interest in atomic warfare and weaponry inspired contributors to the bulletin to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers and destruction that atomic war could bring about.[214] in the 1950s, the bulletin was involved in the formation of the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs, annual conferences of scientists concerned about nuclear proliferation.
historian lawrence s. wittner has argued that anti-nuclear sentiment and activism led directly to government policy shifts about nuclear weapons. public opinion influenced policymakers by limiting their options and also by forcing them to follow certain policies over others. wittner credits public pressure and anti-nuclear activism with "truman’s decision to explore the baruch plan, eisenhower’s efforts towards a nuclear test ban and the 1958 testing moratorium, and kennedy’s signing of the partial test ban treaty".[215]
in terms of nuclear power, forbes magazine, in the september 1975 issue, reported that "the anti-nuclear coalition has been remarkably successful ... [and] has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power."[27] california has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal,[216] and some other u.s. states have a moratorium on construction of nuclear power plants.[217] between 1975 and 1980, a total of 63 nuclear units were canceled in the united states. anti-nuclear activities were among the reasons, but the primary motivations were the overestimation of future demand for electricity and steadily increasing capital costs, which made the economics of new plants unfavorable.[218]
the proliferation of nuclear weapons became a presidential priority issue for the carter administration in the late 1970s.[219] to deal with proliferation problems, president carter promoted stronger international control over nuclear technology, including nuclear reactor technology. although a strong supporter of nuclear power generally, carter turned against the breeder reactor because the plutonium it produced could be diverted into nuclear weapons.[219]
for many years after the 1986 chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries. in recent years, intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear power issues back to the forefront of policy discussion in the nuclear renaissance countries.[53][220] but some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy, through nuclear power phase-out legislation.[220]
under the new zealand nuclear free zone, disarmament, and arms control act 1987, all territorial sea and land of new zealand is declared a nuclear free zone. nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships are prohibited from entering the country's territorial waters. dumping of foreign radioactive waste and development of nuclear weapons in the country is outlawed.[221] despite common misconception, this act does not make nuclear power plants illegal, nor does it make radioactive medical treatments produced in overseas reactors illegal.[222] a 2008 survey shows that 19% of new zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy source, while 77% prefer wind power as the best energy source.[223]
on 26 february 1990, fw de klerk issued orders to terminate the country's nuclear weapons programme, which until then had been a state secret.[224] south africa becomes the first country in the world to voluntary give-up its nuclear weapons programme.
ireland, in 1999, had no plans to change its non-nuclear stance and pursue nuclear power in the future.[225]
in the united states, the navajo nation forbids uranium mining and processing in its land.[226]
in the united states, a 2007 university of maryland survey showed that 73 percent of the public surveyed favours the elimination of all nuclear weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 59 percent support reducing u.s. and russian nuclear stockpiles to 400 weapons each. given the unpopularity of nuclear weapons, u.s. politicians have been wary of supporting new nuclear programs. republican-dominated congresses "have defeated the bush administration's plan to build so-called 'bunker-busters' and 'mini-nukes'."[136]
the megatons to megawatts program converts weapons-grade material from nuclear warheads into fuel for nuclear power plants.[227]
thirty-one countries operate nuclear power plants.[228] nine nations possess nuclear weapons:[229]


today, some 26,000 nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the nine nuclear powers, with thousands on hair-trigger alert. although u.s., russian, and british nuclear arsenals are shrinking in size, those in the four asian nuclear nations—china, india, pakistan, and north korea—are growing, in large part because of tensions among them. this asian arms race also has possibilities of bringing japan into the nuclear club.[98]


during barack obama's successful u.s. presidential election campaign, he advocated the abolition of nuclear weapons.  since his election he has reiterated this goal in several major policy addresses.[98] in 2010, the obama administration negotiated a new weapons accord with russia for a reduction of the maximum number of deployed nuclear weapons on each side from 2,200 to between 1,500 and 1,675—a reduction of some 30 percent. in addition, president obama has committed $15 billion over the next five years to improving the safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile.[230]
following the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster, the italian government put a one-year moratorium on plans to revive nuclear power.[231] on 11–12 june 2011, italian voters passed a referendum to cancel plans for new reactors.  over 94% of the electorate voted in favor of the construction ban, with 55% of the eligible voters participating, making the vote binding.[232]
german chancellor angela merkel's coalition announced on may 30, 2011, that germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following japan's fukushima i nuclear accidents and anti-nuclear protests within germany. seven of the german power stations were closed temporarily in march, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. an eighth was already off line, and will stay so.[233]
as of 2011, countries such as australia, austria, denmark, greece, ireland, italy, latvia, liechtenstein, luxembourg, malta, portugal, israel, malaysia, new zealand, and norway remain opposed to nuclear power.[18][19] germany and switzerland are phasing-out nuclear power.[19][22]

public opinion surveys on nuclear issues[edit]
main article: public opinion on nuclear issues
in 2005, the international atomic energy agency presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the global public opinion on nuclear issues report.[234]  majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of terrorist acts involving radioactive materials at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. while majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down.[234] stressing the climate change benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.[234]
there is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the bbc indicates. the global research agency globescan, commissioned by bbc news, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from july to september 2011, several months after the fukushima nuclear disaster. in countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the uk and us bucking the trend. most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.[42]

criticism[edit]
see also: list of pro-nuclear environmentalists and list of nuclear power groups
 stewart brand at a 2010 debate, "does the world need nuclear energy?"[235]
attempts to reach political agreement on effective policies for climate change continue, and pro-nuclear environmentalists seek to reverse the traditionally anti-nuclear attitudes of environmentalists. filmmaker rob stone's pandora's promise (2013) is a good example of this trend.[236]
some environmentalists criticise the anti-nuclear movement for under-stating the environmental costs of fossil fuels and non-nuclear alternatives, and overstating the environmental costs of nuclear energy.[237][238] of the numerous nuclear experts who have offered their expertise in addressing controversies, bernard cohen, professor emeritus of physics at the university of pittsburgh, is likely the most frequently cited.  in his extensive writings he examines the safety issues in detail.  he is best known for comparing nuclear safety to the relative safety of a wide range of other phenomena.[239][240]
anti-nuclear activists are accused of encouraging radiophobic emotions among the public. the war against the atom (basic books, 1982) samuel maccracken of boston university argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. he argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each us non-nuclear power plant could be held responsible for about 100 deaths per year.[241]
the nuclear energy institute[242] (nei) is the main lobby group for companies doing nuclear work in the united states, while most countries that employ nuclear energy have a national industry group. the world nuclear association is the only global trade body.  in seeking to counteract the arguments of nuclear opponents, it points to independent studies that quantify the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and compares them to the costs and benefits of alternatives.  nei sponsors studies of its own, but it also references studies performed for the world health organization,[243] for the international energy agency,[244] and by university researchers.[245]
critics of the anti-nuclear movement point to independent studies that show that the capital resources required for renewable energy sources are higher than those required for nuclear power.[244]
some people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, criticise the movement on the basis of the claim that nuclear power is necessary for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. these individuals include james lovelock,[237] originator of the gaia hypothesis, patrick moore,[238] a co-founder of greenpeace and former director of greenpeace international, george monbiot and stewart brand, creator of the whole earth catalog.[246][247] lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products.[248] in a january 2008 interview, moore said that "it wasn't until after i'd left greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that i started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that i had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."[249]
some anti-nuclear organisations have acknowledged that their positions are subject to review.[250]
in april 2007, dan becker, director of global warming for the sierra club, declared, "switching from dirty coal plants to dangerous nuclear power is like giving up smoking cigarettes and taking up crack."[251]  james lovelock criticizes holders of such a view: "opposition to nuclear energy is based on irrational fear fed by hollywood-style fiction, the green lobbies and the media."  ". . .i am a green and i entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy."[237]
george monbiot, an english writer known for his environmental and political activism, once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry.[252] he finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in march 2011. although he "still loathe[s] the liars who run the nuclear industry",[253] monbiot now advocates its use, having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the 2011 japan tsunami on nuclear reactors in the region.[253] subsequently, he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement, writing that it "has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health ... made [claims] ungrounded in science, unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong." he singled out helen caldicott for, he wrote, making unsourced and inaccurate claims, dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up, and overstating the death toll from the chernobyl disaster by a factor of more than 140.[254]

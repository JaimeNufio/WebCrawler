history[edit]
originally formed in the 1920s with the name italian libyan colonial division, this was a formation of colonial troops raised by the italians in their colony in libya and participated in the invasion of ethiopia in the second italo-abyssinian war.
this formation was reorganized into the "1st libyan infantry division sibelle" by the beginning of italy's entry into world war ii. it had 7224 men (mostly native libyans).[1]
in september 1940, the 1st libyan division (commanded by general sibelle and named after him) participated in the italian invasion of egypt. on september 13 the entire 1st libyan division, including a regiment of libyan paratroopers attacked sollum on the egyptian northern coast, held by platoons of coldstream guards.[2] the british laid mines in the area and quickly withdrew to marsa matruh after suffering 50 casualties.
in december the british started a counter-offensive. the arabs and paratroopers of 1st libyan division fought hard on the december 10, 1940, amid a howling sandstorm, until on december 11 the division began to disintegrate with heavy losses.[3] the division had dug in at maktila near sidi barrani and was forced to surrender after heavy fighting during operation compass.[4]

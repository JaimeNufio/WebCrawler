 regional number of world heritage sites in italy (2018)
the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (unesco) world heritage sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the unesco world heritage convention, established in 1972.[1] italy ratified the convention on june 23, 1978, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.[2] as of 2018, italy has a total of 54 inscribed properties, making it the state party with the most world heritage sites.[3]
sites in italy were first inscribed on the list at the 3rd session of the world heritage committee, held in cairo and luxor, egypt in 1979. at that session, one site was added: the "rock drawings in valcamonica".[4] a total of 25 (approximately half), of all italian sites were added during the 1990s (where it was a member of the world heritage committee for the entire decade) with 10 sites added at the 21st session held in naples, italy in 1997. italy has served as a member of the world heritage committee four times, specifically, 1978-1985 (8 years), 1987-1993 (7 years), 1993-1999 (7 years), and 1999-2001 (3 years).[5]
out of italy's 54 heritage sites, five are shared with other countries: "monte san giorgio" and "rhaetian railway in the albula / bernina landscapes" with switzerland; "historic centre of rome" with the vatican; "prehistoric pile dwellings around the alps" with austria, france, germany, slovenia and switzerland; and "venetian works of defence between 15th and 17th centuries: stato da terra – western stato da mar with croatia and montenegro. five world heritage sites in italy are of the natural type, all others are cultural sites (49). therefore, italy has the largest number of world "cultural" heritage sites followed by spain with 41 cultural sites.[2]

points of interest related to italy on wikipedia:outline – history – portal – category – wikiproject – alerts – deletions – cleanup – stubs – assessment – to-do







this wikiproject has been formed to foster the improvement of wikipedia’s coverage of italy—both the modern nation state and the rich and bewildering variety of historical states and cultures which have inhabited its territory. we intend to work in a spirit of cooperation with the many wikipedians who have contributed to articles on “italian” subjects.
this page and its future subpages contain suggestions on formatting and layout of articles, which can be discussed at the project's talk page. to participate simply add your name to the participants section, including (if you so wish) any particular interests or relevant specialisms.

 scope[edit]
this project aims to address the production, improvement and coordination of articles related to italy—its geography, history, culture, languages, politics, etc., all seen in their broadest senses.  it intends to expand wikipedia's resources on the subject in a fair and accurate manner and to act as a locus where controversies can be aired and hopefully resolved.

 participants[edit]
project members are encouraged to add {{user wikiproject italy}} to their user pages to identify themselves as members of the project.

structure and navigation[edit]
refine and maintain the list of basic italy topics, a key guide on wikipedia to italy as a subject. it serves as a table of contents, summary, and topic outline of coverage on the country italy and is the most useful tool on wikipedia for exploring and understanding fundamental material about italy (and how it fits together) on wikipedia.  its purpose is an important one:  it simply enables readers to see at a glance how the subject of italy is broken down, what the component topics are, and how they relate to each other - that is, how information on italy is organized (here, and in the world-at-large).  it is a site map and outline of knowledge that demystifies the subject known as "italy".  because of its central role in the presentation of wikipedia's coverage of this subject, it is very important to develop and maintain it to the highest level of quality:  to help readers improve their conceptual awareness and understanding of italy as well as find their way around this subject on wikipedia.  for examples of other pages in this set, see list of basic france topics, list of basic thailand topics, list of basic japan topics, list of basic taiwan topics, and list of basic iceland topics, all of which are currently completed to a higher level of quality than this page.  in other words, it's getting its ass kicked:  the list of basic italy topics is incomplete, needs your editing contributions, and is especially in need of maps and pictures!
refine and maintain category:italy and its subcategories.

 resources[edit]
 infoboxes[edit]
communes[edit]
articles on italian communes (or comuni or municipalities) should use the template citybox it infobox. where this is missing the template comune will automagically transform the infobox from the corresponding article in the italian wikipedia into this format. (number and date formats and probably links will need to be tidied up manually, however.) the basic procedure is to go to the italian article, click the ‘modifica’ (i.e. ‘edit this page’) tab and copy the template code section i.e. the bit which begins with the line

{{template:comune
and ends with the line

}} <!-- fine della tabella - per la compilazione vedi -> aiuto:comune -->
paste that into the top of the english article. change the line

{{template:comune
to

{{subst:comune
and save. edit the article again to fix any issues with what is now the standard template citybox it.

translation and style guides[edit]
tag stubs that have more coverage in the italian wikipedia with this article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in italian.  click [show] for important translation instructions.

machine translation like deepl or google translate  is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the english wikipedia.
do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality. if possible, verify the text with references provided in the foreign-language article.
you must provide copyright attribution in the edit summary accompanying your translation by providing an interlanguage link to the source of your translation. a model attribution edit summary (using german): content in this edit is translated from the existing german wikipedia article at [[:de:exact name of german article]]; see its history for attribution.
you should also add the template {{translated page}} to the talk page.
for more guidance, see wikipedia:translation. to make sure that the article will be translated.
 websites[edit]
www.araldicacivica.it - a site with coat of arms usable here (see user talk:attilios/licenses for license).
www.comuni-italiani.it - a reliable source of basic information about italian comuni: population, elevation, when the mayor was elected and his/her political affiliations, etc.

 "fighter guide map no. 1b, darwin area", march 1944. produced for air defence purposes by the royal australian air force. the map includes many of the air fields which were targeted by japanese aircraft.
between february 1942 and november 1943, during the pacific war, the australian mainland, domestic airspace, offshore islands and coastal shipping were attacked at least 97 times by aircraft from the imperial japanese navy air force and imperial japanese army air force. these attacks came in various forms; from large-scale raids by medium bombers, to torpedo attacks on ships, and to strafing runs by fighters.
in the first and deadliest set of attacks, 242 aircraft hit darwin on the morning of 19 february 1942. killing at least 235 people and causing immense damage, the attacks made hundreds of people homeless and resulted in the abandonment of darwin as a major naval base.
these attacks were opposed by, and often aimed at, units and personnel from the royal australian air force (raaf), australian army, royal australian navy, united states army air forces, united states navy, british royal air force and royal netherlands east indies air force. japanese aircrews also targeted civil infrastructure, including harbours, civil airfields, railways and fuel tanks. some civilians were also killed.
although the main defence was provided by raaf and allied fighters, a number of australian army anti-aircraft batteries in northern australia were also involved in dealing with the threat of japanese air raids.[1]

early japanese air raids[edit]
the japanese conducted a series of air raids on australia during february and march 1942. these raids sought to prevent the allies from using bases in northern australia to contest the conquest of the netherlands east indies.

the first air raid on darwin[edit]
main article: bombing of darwin
 the explosion of the mv neptuna, hit during the first japanese air raid on darwin. in the foreground is hmas deloraine, which escaped damage.
the bombing of darwin on 19 february 1942 was both the first and the largest attack mounted by japan against mainland australia, when four japanese aircraft carriers (akagi, kaga, hiryū and sōryū) launched a total of 188 aircraft from a position in the timor sea.[2] these 188 naval aircraft inflicted heavy damage on darwin and sank eight ships. a raid conducted by 54 land-based army bombers later the same day inflicted further damage on the town and raaf base darwin and resulted in the destruction of 20 military aircraft. allied casualties were 235 killed and between 300 and 400 wounded, the majority of whom were non-australian allied sailors. only four japanese aircraft (all navy carrier-borne) were confirmed to have been destroyed by darwin's defenders.[3]

the attack on broome[edit]
main article: attack on broome
see also: western australian emergency of march 1942
on 3 march 1942, nine japanese a6m3 zero fighters attacked the town of broome, in northern western australia. although broome was a small town, it had become a significant air base and route of escape for refugees and retreating military personnel, following the japanese invasion of java. during the attack, which consisted of strafing runs only by the zeros, at least 88 allied civilians and military personnel were killed and 24 aircraft were lost. as broome was almost undefended, japanese losses were light, with only a single zero being shot down over broome and another one failing to reach its base.[4]

attacks on north queensland, july 1942[edit]
 two australian soldiers searching for fragments of a bomb dropped during the third raid on townsville.
japanese naval flying boats conducted four small air raids on the north queensland towns of townsville and mossman in late july 1942. townsville, which was an important military base, was raided by japanese kawanishi h8k1 "emily" flying boats operating from rabaul on three nights in late july 1942. on the night of 25/26 july, the town was attacked by two flying boats but did not suffer any damage as the six bombs dropped by these aircraft fell into the sea. townsville was attacked for the second time in the early hours of 28 july when a single flying boat dropped eight bombs which landed in bushland outside the town. six p-39 airacobras unsuccessfully attempted to intercept the japanese aircraft. the third raid on townsville occurred in the early hours of 29 july when a single flying boat again attacked the town, dropping seven bombs into the sea and an eighth which fell on an agricultural research station at oonoonba, damaging a coconut plantation. this aircraft was intercepted by four airacobras and was damaged. the fourth raid on north queensland occurred on the night of 31 july when a single flying boat dropped a bomb which exploded near a house outside of mossman, injuring a child.[5]

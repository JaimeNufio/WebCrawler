difficulties which industry in turin has faced include a long phase of industrial restructuring; a crisis in fiat; and transfer of production to developing nations.

automotive[edit]
data from 2006 indicated that growth in italian gdp at that time was due to resumption of exports of cars from the fiat group. associated automotive industries also benefited. such automotive companies include iveco, alfa romeo, abarth and lancia, pininfarina, bertone and giugiaro).
general motors, while breaking a commercial and productive alliance with fiat, continued research in the testing of diesel engines.
the automotive components industry has expanded and modernised in response to fiat's success. there is a network of over 350 companies.[citation needed]
the turin chamber of commerce's "from concept to car" project, involving 145 companies aimed to promote the excellence of the sector throughout the world.[4]

tertiary sector[edit]

already a destination for the grand tour, turin was one of the first italian cities in history to have a tourist organization; for example, for the three hundred years of the miracle of the ss. sacramento, the bookseller giovanni gaspare craveri published the guida de 'forestieri ("foreigners' guide"). craveri's guide subdivides the visit of the city in four days and describes in great detail also the surroundings. that of craveri was followed by other guides, always edited by turinese people proud of their city; for example in 1781 onorato derossi published his nuova guida per la città di torino ("new guide for the city of turin".)
the 2006 winter olympics contributed to turin's progress after a period of economic doldrums. however, some were not sure of its effect.

"giorgetto giugiaro, whose classic industrial designs range from canon cameras to vw [said], "turin is a modest city intent on doing things,"... "if the villas we have in la collinas were in milan, people would call them the beverly hills of europe. but our problem is that we are not able to talk about what we have." giugiaro told me about a friend who owns two rolls-royces but won't take them out, for fear of showing off. "so he drives around town in an ordinary car and leaves his rolls in the garage." the city's versace store had to close because locals wouldn't be caught dead in such ostentatious clothes, and hermès has to stock plain white paper shopping bags so patrons can carry its understated luxury home without risking any fashion statements along the way."[7]
in 2008, the turin area was visited by 5.3 million tourists.[8]

recent changes[edit]
the conversion of large urban areas, previously occupied by factories has contributed to recent economic growth.
large public works such as passante ferroviario di torino and the metro, have also reshaped the city.
since 2000, turin, as a place of origin of italian cinema has housed the national museum of cinema at mole antonelliana. in 2008, with 532,196 visitors, it reached the thirteenth most visited place among italian museums.[citation needed] cineporto, a multipurpose facility dedicated to high-tech film productions and the lumiq studios, which produces film, television and advertising.

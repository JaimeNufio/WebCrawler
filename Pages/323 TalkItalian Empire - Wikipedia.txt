3 italian ambitions of spain becoming a client state of theirs
4 colonization vs occupation


the map.[edit]
the map doesn't show italian possesions in istria and dalmatia around zara and ragusa. since this is 1940, it should show these areas coloured in green.
http://history.sandiego.edu/cdr2/ww2pics/81736.jpg
(addition) italy gained albania in april 1939 that should be labeled green to show italian possessions before they entered in wwii, of which albania was a part of the empire before they joined wwii. i suggest albania turn green to reflect this.  — preceding unsigned comment added by ace score (talk • contribs) 04:06, 24 december 2014 (utc)

please stop adding maps that show italy possessing east africa in 1942, it lost east africa in 1941[edit]
 this is a map posted on this page by nick mon that is historically inaccurate.
the user nick mon repeatedly keeps re-adding inaccurate maps that show italy possessing east africa in 1942. it lost east africa by spring 1941, as the british fully occupied the territory by then, only sporadic resistance by some few remaining diehard fascist guerilla forces continued afterwards. it did not possess tunisia until late 1942 after it lost east africa. that is completely false and ridiculous, and this user has had these additions removed several times upon being told of the falsehood of it, yet they repeatedly re-add this material. this is the last time that this should be tolerated here. if nick mon yet again rejects this obvious fact and re-posts a map showing italy possessing east africa in 1942, this should be considered deliberate disregard for fact-checking and historical accuracy, and nick mon should be reported should this happen again.  — preceding unsigned comment added by 70.26.113.85 (talk) 18:51, 28 december 2013 (utc)

this is an old issue. the contested map applies the same concept as the main map shown in british empire. the problem is the caption, which should say something like: "all areas of the world that have ever been under italian control". anyway, also so the map is imprecise, because for example s-w anatolia (occupied after wwi) is missing. moreover, i don`t see the utility of such a representation, since the article deals with the italian colonial empire (btw, for the fascists "l`impero" was only east africa). this means that we should only show the italian possessions which had a juridic status of colony or similar. a map showing the status at the outbreak of wwii would suffice. alex2006 (talk) 14:46, 29 december 2013 (utc)
italian ambitions of spain becoming a client state of theirs[edit]
i had never heard that before and it sounds really strange to me. maybe the source wasn't understood correctly/taken out of context or something like that by whoever made the map? --schweinchen (talk) 14:57, 3 august 2014 (utc)

or maybe it was used the usual wikipedia wp:fringe source, ignoring (because of ignorance) the mainstream...alex2006 (talk) 16:49, 3 august 2014 (utc)
colonization vs occupation[edit]
ethiopia was occupied by fascist italy for five years. we in ethiopia recognize those periods as a time of occupation. we don't consider that as colonization.
france was occupied by nazi germany for four years. was that colonization?
the other story you touched very lightly was the first ethio-italian war. the italians were totally humiliated and it is recorded as the first defeat a european colonial power was forced to taste at the hands of africans. 
ethiopia has been independent throughout its time. it has never been a colony. if you consider occupation to be the same as colonialization, then write that france was a colony of germany during the wwii.  
in short, the whole article seems too inaccurate. better consider to write it down based on facts, free of bias — preceding unsigned comment added by 185.120.126.9 (talk) 01:41, 20 july 2016 (utc)

it is true that italy's colonial venture in ethiopia was short-lived and was in many ways more like a long military occupation than the colonial regime in neighbouring eritrea. it is also true, though, that there are some big differences between the ethiopian case and the french case. italy claimed ethiopia as a colony, and in the tense international situation of the late 1930s, this claim was widely recognized. germany did not claim more than a small part of france. it left the french government in control of most of the country and all of the colonies. the ethiopian government disappeared or went into exile. german policies in france were never colonialist. the true military occupation of france lasted only from november 1942 through the summer of 1944, less than two years. srnec (talk) 01:46, 21 july 2016 (utc)
i would say italian-occupied ethiopia was not considered a legitimate italian possession in international law and in the eyes of a number of countries. the league of nations, to which the independent empire of ethiopia belonged, never recognized the legitimacy of italian rule in ethiopia and many league members followed suit. britain continued to recognized the exiled haile selassie as the legitimate ruler of ethiopia and in 1942 haile selassie progressively resumed rule over ethiopia as soon the italian army retreated before the invading british forces (which remained in control over the main cities for a while). italian property was seized and italian nationals were summarily expulsed from ethiopia, not being protected by international law as they were considered illegal occupants and not residents of a recognized italian possession. ethiopia was also one of the original signatories of the united nations charter. on the other hand, allied-occupied libya, eritrea and somalia remained italian colonies in international law until the peace treaty with italy in 1947.
britain initially recognized haile selassie as the legal government of ethiopia, but it switched its recognition to the king of italy in 1938. many states followed this path, initially refusing recognition (like the league) and then gradually extending de facto and finally de jure recognition to italy. the united states and the soviet union never did recognise italy's claim, and ethiopia never had its league membership revoked (so far as i can tell). i agree that its international status was unclear compared to italy's other colonies, but italian activity in ethiopia and the international attitude towards it make the situation much more like that of a colonisation than a military occupation. is there a specific part of the article that is problematic? srnec (talk) 01:35, 22 july 2016 (utc)

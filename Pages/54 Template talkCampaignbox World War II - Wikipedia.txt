needed?[edit]
since we've got template:wwiitheatre, i don't think we need this one. oberiko 21:22, 11 august 2006 (utc)

actually, i would turn that one into normal campaignboxes instead.  there's really no need to have these huge templates everywhere (although {{world war ii}} is far worse in this regard). 02:08, 12 august 2006 (utc)
i've started a discussion of this at wikipedia talk:wikiproject military history/world war ii task force, where hopefully more people will notice it and take part. kirill lokshin 02:29, 12 august 2006 (utc)
kirill you beat me to it.  i was about to restore your version but you and i had an edit clash. :-) --philip baird shearer 19:54, 21 march 2007 (utc)

ah, no problem. :-) kirill lokshin 21:38, 21 march 2007 (utc)
yugoslavian front[edit]
the yugoslavian front (wwii) article is progressing nicely.  it makes sense to divorce it from the balkans campaign, which focuses mainly on german and italian invasions of albania, greece in yugoslavia ending in 1941.  not sure if it needs to be this prominent.  on one hand, it certainly was strategically important, as as large as some other parts of wwii linked to from this template.  on the other hand, it would make sense to create a "balkans sub-theater" article, which would branch out to the balkans campaign, yugoslav front, greek resistance, allied operations in the area (air raids, eg on ploesti), and soviets entering the fray in 1944.  miranche 03:57, 25 march 2007 (utc)

i agree aboutthe proposal for a "balkans-aegean sub-theater", including the 1940-41 balkans campaign, the yugoslav and greek resistance movements, the dodecanese campaign, special operations, etc., as the current structure is too limited. regards, cplakidas 16:38, 18 april 2007 (utc)
i went ahead and linked directly to world war ii in yugoslavia from the template, as it's a substantial article and it wasn't referenced anywhere from the main sub-theaters. it fits least uncomfortably under the mediterranean and middle east theatre, so i included it in that template as well. the greek and albanian resistance movements still await their inclusion. – miranche t c 18:58, 28 august 2016 (utc)

north west europe?[edit]
when is it actually called this?  was operation dragoon part of the "north west europe" campaign as well?  the article is called western front, so why not "western front (1944-1945)"? john k (talk) 23:07, 2 may 2009 (utc)

ecuadoran-peruvian war[edit]
i suggest it be deleted from the list of contemporaneous wars because, unlike the others, it bore no relation to wwii.93.183.226.30 (talk) 01:15, 10 may 2009 (utc)

exactly what i was thinking, the ecuadoran border conflict of 1941 has so relevance to ww2 other than they were fought at the same time. i am making changes now.--az81964444 (talk) 07:20, 2 april 2010 (utc)
wikipedia 'experts' strike again[edit]
it seems to me that this 'information box' was created by someone uninformed on the definition of military campaign.

poland - is a country! there were at least two campaigns
phoney war - was part of the 1st polish campaign
denmark & norway - there were two campaigns affecting these countries
france & benelux - was a theatre with at least two campaigns affecting these regions
britain - is a country! there were separate air and naval campaigns
balkans - is a region! there was a theatre in which there were at least three campaigns here: initial occupation, versus the partisans, and liberation
yugoslav front - was the partisan campaign (above)
eastern front - in fact is the german war against ussr, so a theatre, and included several campaigns seem from german and soviet perspectives
finland - is a country! there was a series of operations part of the german campaigns
western front (1944–45) - was a theatre with a series of campaigns
asia & the pacific

china - is a country! there was in fact a theatre that included several japanese, chinese and allied campaigns
pacific ocean - is an ocean! in ww2 it was divided into several theatres, each included several campaigns
south-east asia - is a region! there was a theatre with several campaigns
south west pacific - is a region! there was a theatre within the pacific ocean
japan - is a country! in the military sense it was subject to a naval, and air and a proposed ground campaigns
manchuria (1945) - is a defunct state/region! the campaign conducted through it had objectives in china and korea
mediterranean, middle east and africa
other campaigns

atlantic - is an ocean! there were several campaigns in its three regions
strategic bombing - is a type of air campaign! several such campaigns were conducted by the major ww2 participants
america - comes in the north and south varieties, and are continents! several campaigns can be listed here
contemporaneous wars - don't belong in the campaigns of ww2 info box!

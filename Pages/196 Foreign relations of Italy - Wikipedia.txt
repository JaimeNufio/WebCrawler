foreign relations of the italian republic are the italian government's external relations with the outside world. located in europe, italy has been considered a major western power  since its unification in 1861.[1] its main allies are the nato countries and the eu states, two entities of which italy is a founding member.
italy has a particular role within the christian world because rome is the seat of the pope and the center of the catholic church. italy acts as a mediator in the israeli–palestinian conflict and has many troops deployed in the middle east, and all over the world for peacekeeping missions, and for combating organized crime, illegal drug trade, human trafficking, piracy and terrorism. italy is currently commanding various multinational forces.[2] the country plays also a significant role in former colonies and territories of the italian empire and is considered a key player in the mediterranean region.

history[edit]
see also: risorgimento, kingdom of italy, italian empire, and italian civil war
 the stages of italian unification during 1829–71
the risorgimento was the era 1830–1870 that saw the emergence of a national consciousness. italians achieved independence from austria, the house of bourbon and from the pope, securing national unification.[3][4] the papacy called france to resist unification, fearing that giving up control of the papal states would weaken the church and allow the liberals to dominate conservative catholics.[5] italy captured rome in 1870 and later formed the triple alliance (1882) with germany and austria.
italy defeated the ottoman empire in 1911–1912.[6] by 1914, italy had acquired in africa a colony on the red sea coast (eritrea), a large protectorate in somalia and administrative authority in formerly turkish libya. outside of africa, italy possessed a small concession in tientsin in china (following the boxer rebellion) and the dodecanese islands off the coast of turkey.
austria took the offensive against the terms of the alliance and italy decided to take part in world war i as a principal allied power with france and great britain.  two leaders, prime minister antonio salandra and foreign minister sidney sonnino made the decisions; their primary motivation was seizure of territory from austria, as secretly promised by britain and france in the treaty of london of 1915. italy was very poorly prepared for war, in terms of military strength, leadership, and finances, and had to be repeatedly rescued by britain and france financially and militarily. italy occupied southern albania and established a protectorate over albania, which remained in place until 1920.[7]  the allies defeated the austrian empire in 1918 and italy became one of the main winners of the war.  at the paris peace conference in 1919, prime minister vittorio emanuele orlando focused almost exclusively on territorial gains, but he got far less than he wanted, and italians were bitterly resentful when they were denied control of the city of fiume  the conference, under the control of britain, france and the united states refused to assign dalmazia and albania to italy as had been promised in the treaty of london.  britain, france and japan divided the german overseas colonies into mandates of their own, excluding italy. italy also gained no territory from the breakup of the ottoman empire.  civil unrest erupted in italy between nationalists who supported the war effort and opposed what they called the "mutilated victory" (as nationalists referred to it) and leftists who were opposed to the war.[8]
the fascist government that came to power with benito mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the italian empire and to satisfy the claims of italian irredentists. in 1935–36, in its second invasion of ethiopia italy was successful and merged its new conquest with its older east african colonies. in 1939, italy invaded albania and incorporated it into the fascist state. during the second world war (1939–45), italy formed the axis alliance with japan and germany and occupied several territories (such as parts of france, greece, egypt and tunisia) but was forced in the final peace to abandon all its colonies and protectorates. following the civil war and the economic depression caused by world war ii, italy enjoyed an economic miracle, promoted european unity, joined nato and became an active member of the european union.[9] italy was granted a united nations trust to administer somaliland in 1950. when somalia became independent in 1960, italy's eight-decade experience with colonialism ended.

the holy see maintains formal diplomatic relations with 176 sovereign states, the european union, and the order of malta; 69 of the diplomatic missions accredited to the holy see are situated in rome, though those countries than have two embassies in the same city, since, by agreement between the holy see and italy, the same person cannot be accredited simultaneously to both. this is shown clearly by the fact that italy recognizes the people's republic of china, and as such, the chinese embassy is in rome.  however, the vatican city state recognizes the taiwan, and as such, taiwan's embassy to the holy see is also in rome. as italy was the first country to recognize the holy see as a sovereign nation, their embassy was the first one established.

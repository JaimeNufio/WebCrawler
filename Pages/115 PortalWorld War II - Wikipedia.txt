edit the world war ii portal

world war ii, or the second world war, was a global military conflict. it began as the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts, with the first beginning in asia in 1937 (the second sino-japanese war) and the other beginning in europe in 1939 (the german and soviet invasion of poland).
the war split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the allies and the axis. it involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history, and placed the participants in a state of "total war", which erased the distinction between civil and military resources and resulted in the complete activation of a nation's economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities for the purposes of the war effort. over 70 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.
the allies won the war, and as a result, the soviet union and the united states emerged as the world's leading superpowers. this set the stage for the cold war, which lasted for the next 45 years. the united nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict. the self-determination spawned by the war accelerated decolonization movements in asia and africa, while europe itself began moving toward integration.

mauthausen concentration camp (known from the summer of 1940 as mauthausen-gusen concentration camp) grew to become a large group of nazi concentration camps that were built around the villages of mauthausen and gusen in upper austria, roughly 20 km east of the city of linz.initially a single camp at mauthausen, it expanded over time to become one of the largest labour camp complexes in german-controlled europe.apart from the four main sub-camps at mauthausen and nearby gusen, more than 50 sub-camps, located throughout austria and southern germany, used the inmates as slave labour.  several subordinate camps of the kz mauthausen complex included quarries, munitions factories, mines, arms factories and me 262 fighter-plane assembly plants.in january 1945, the camps, directed from the central office in mauthausen, contained roughly 85,000 inmates.the death toll remains unknown, although most sources place it between 122,766 and 320,000 for the entire complex.  the camps formed one of the first massive concentration camp complexes in nazi germany, and were the last ones to be liberated by the western allies or the soviet union.  the two main camps, mauthausen and gusen i, were also the only two camps in the whole of europe to be labelled as "grade iii" camps, which meant that they were intended to be the toughest camps for the "incorrigible political enemies of the reich".

edit selected equipment

the t-26 was a light tank used by the soviet union from the 1930s until world war ii. it was based on the british vickers 6-ton tank and widely considered one of the most successful designs of the 1930s.the t-26 made-up the majority of the red army's armour force until late 1941, and saw a long history in the armed forces of various different nations around the world. for almost a decade the t-26 proved to be one of the best tanks in production, with a total of around 12,000 units produced.success and failure in the spanish civil war, where it served as the most widely used tank, ultimately played a major role in influencing the soviet doctrine of tank warfare in the late 1930s. the t-26 participated in german invasion of the soviet union in 1941 as one of the most numerous tanks inservice,contributing to the defense of the soviet union.although the t-26's reputation was marred by its abysmal performance during world war ii, it was nevertheless the most important tank of the spanish civil war and played major roles during the winter war and the battle of khalkhin gol in 1939. between its introduction and its retirement, the t-26 saw a great deal of modernization efforts between 1932 and 1941.

edit selected battle

the battle of the tenaru (or  battle of the ilu river) took place august 21, 1942, on the island of guadalcanal, and was a land battle of the pacific campaign of world war ii, between imperial japanese army and allied (mainly united states (u.s.) marine) ground forces.  the battle was the first major japanese land offensive during the guadalcanal campaign.in the battle, u.s. marines, under the overall command of u.s. major general alexander vandegrift, successfully repulsed an assault by the "first element" of the "ichiki" regiment, under the command of japanese colonel kiyonao ichiki.  the marines were defending the lunga perimeter, which guarded henderson field, which was captured by the allies in landings on guadalcanal on august 7.  ichiki's unit was sent to guadalcanal in response to the allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the allied forces off of the island.  underestimating the strength of allied forces on guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 11,000 personnel, ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on marine positions at alligator creek on the east side of the lunga perimeter.  ichiki's assault was defeated with heavy losses for the japanese attackers.

edit selected biography

harry s. truman was the thirty-third president of the united states (1945–1953). as vice president, he succeeded franklin d. roosevelt, who died less than three months after he began his fourth term.during world war i truman served as an artillery officer. after the war he became part of the political machine of tom pendergast and was elected a county judge in missouri and eventually a united states senator. after he gained national prominence as head of the wartime truman committee, truman replaced vice president henry a. wallace as roosevelt's running mate in 1944.as president, truman faced challenge after challenge in domestic affairs. the disorderly reconversion of the economy of the united states was marked by severe shortages, numerous strikes, and the passage of the taft-hartley act over his veto. he confounded all predictions to win re-election in 1948, largely due to his famous whistle stop tour of rural america. after his re-election he was able to pass only one of the proposals in his fair deal program.

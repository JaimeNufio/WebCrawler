or ww2), also known as the second world war, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. the vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the allies and the axis. a state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. world war ii was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the soviet union and china. it included massacres, the genocide of the holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.[1][2][3][4]japan, which aimed to dominate asia and the pacific, was at war with china by 1937,[5][b] though neither side had declared war on the other. world war ii is generally said to have begun on 1 september 1939,[6] with the invasion of poland by germany and subsequent declarations on germany by france and the united kingdom. from late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, germany conquered or controlled much of continental europe, and formed the axis alliance with italy and japan. under the molotov–ribbentrop pact of august 1939, germany and the soviet union partitioned and annexed territories of their european neighbours, poland, finland, romania and the baltic states. following the onset of campaigns in north africa and east africa, and the fall of france in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the european axis powers and the british empire. war in the balkans, the aerial battle of britain, the blitz, and the long battle of the atlantic followed. on 22 june 1941, the european axis powers launched an invasion of the soviet union, opening the largest land theatre of war in history. this eastern front trapped the axis, most crucially the german wehrmacht, into a war of attrition. in december 1941, japan launched a surprise attack on the united states and european colonies in the pacific. following an immediate u.s. declaration of war against japan, supported by one from great britain, the european axis powers quickly declared war on the u.s. in solidarity with their japanese ally. rapid japanese conquests over much of the western pacific ensued, perceived by many in asia as liberation from western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.the axis advance in the pacific halted in 1942 when japan lost the critical battle of midway; later, germany and italy were defeated in north africa and then, decisively, at stalingrad in the soviet union. key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of german defeats on the eastern front, the allied invasions of sicily and italy, and allied victories in the pacific, cost the axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. in 1944, the western allies invaded german-occupied france, while the soviet union regained its territorial losses and turned toward germany and its allies. during 1944 and 1945 the japanese suffered major reverses in mainland asia in central china, south china and burma, while the allies crippled the japanese navy and captured key western pacific islands.the war in europe concluded with an invasion of germany by the western allies and the soviet union, culminating in the capture of berlin by soviet troops, the suicide of adolf hitler and the german unconditional surrender on 8 may 1945. following the potsdam declaration by the allies on 26 july 1945 and the refusal of japan to surrender under its terms, the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki on 6 and 9 august respectively. with an invasion of the japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the soviet entry into the war against japan and its invasion of manchuria, japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 august 1945, cementing total victory in asia for the allies. tribunals were set up by fiat by the allies and war crimes trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the germans and the japanese.world war ii changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. the united nations (un) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious great powers—china, france, the soviet union, the united kingdom, and the united states—became the permanent members of its security council.[7] the soviet union and united states emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long cold war. in the wake of european devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of africa and asia. most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. political integration, especially in europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and create a common identity.[8].mw-parser-output

september 1939,[9][10] beginning with the german invasion of poland; the united kingdom and france declared war on germany two days later. the dates for the beginning of war in the pacific include the start of the second sino-japanese war on 7 july 1937,[11][12] or even the japanese invasion of manchuria on 19 september 1931.[13][14]others follow the british historian a.j.p. taylor, who held that the sino-japanese war and war in europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars merged in 1941. this article uses the conventional dating. other starting dates sometimes used for world war ii include the italian invasion of abyssinia on 3 october 1935.[15] the british historian antony beevor views the beginning of world war ii as the battles of khalkhin gol fought between japan and the forces of mongolia and the soviet union from may to september 1939.[16]the exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. it was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 august 1945 (v-j day), rather than the formal surrender of japan, which was on 2 september 1945 that officially ended the war in asia. a peace treaty with japan was signed in 1951.[17] a treaty regarding germany's future allowed the reunification of east and west germany to take place in 1990 and resolved most post-world war ii issues.[18] no formal peace treaty between japan and the soviet union was ever signed.[19]backgroundmain article: causes of world war iieuropeworld war i had radically altered the political european map, with the defeat of the central powers—including austria-hungary, germany, bulgaria and the ottoman empire—and the 1917 bolshevik seizure of power in russia, which eventually led to the founding of the soviet union. meanwhile, the victorious allies of world war i, such as france, belgium, italy, romania and greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of austria-hungary and the ottoman and russian empires. the league of nations assembly, held in geneva, switzerland, 1930to prevent a future world war, the league of nations was created during the 1919 paris peace conference. the organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.despite strong pacifist sentiment after world war i,[20] its aftermath still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several european states. these sentiments were especially marked in germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the treaty of versailles. under the treaty, germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of its overseas possessions, while german annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.[21] adolf hitler at a german national socialist political rally in nuremberg, august 1933the german empire was dissolved in the german revolution of 1918–1919, and a democratic government, later known as the weimar republic, was created. the interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left. italy, as an entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the united kingdom and france to secure italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. from 1922 to 1925, the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power, promising the creation of a "new roman empire".[22]adolf hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in 1923, eventually became the chancellor of germany in 1933. he abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign.[23] meanwhile, france, to secure its alliance, allowed italy a free hand in ethiopia, which italy desired as a colonial possession. the situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the territory of the saar basin was legally reunited with germany and hitler repudiated the treaty of versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.[24]the united kingdom, france and italy formed the stresa front in april 1935 in order to contain germany, a key step towards military globalization; however, that june, the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany, easing prior restrictions. the soviet union, concerned by germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france. before taking effect though, the franco-soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the league of nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.[25] the united states, concerned with events in europe and asia, passed the neutrality act in august of the same year.[26]hitler defied the versailles and locarno treaties by remilitarising the rhineland in march 1936, encountering little opposition due to appeasement.[27] in october 1936, germany and italy formed the rome–berlin axis. a month later, germany and japan signed the anti-comintern pact, which italy would join in the following year.[28]asiathe kuomintang (kmt) party in china launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified china in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former chinese communist party allies[29] and new regional warlords. in 1931, an increasingly militaristic empire of japan, which had long sought influence in china[30] as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule asia, used the mukden incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of manchuria and establish the puppet state of manchukuo.[31]china appealed to the league of nations to stop the japanese invasion of manchuria. japan withdrew from the league of nations after being condemned for its incursion into manchuria. the two nations then fought several battles, in shanghai, rehe and hebei, until the tanggu truce was signed in 1933. thereafter, chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to japanese aggression in manchuria, and chahar and suiyuan.[32] after the 1936 xi'an incident, the kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose japan.[33]pre-war eventsitalian invasion of ethiopia (1935)main article: second italo-ethiopian war benito mussolini inspecting troops during the italo-ethiopian war, 1935the second italo–ethiopian war was a brief colonial war that began in october 1935 and ended in may 1936. the war began with the invasion of the ethiopian empire (also known as abyssinia) by the armed forces of the kingdom of italy (regno d'italia), which was launched from italian somaliland and eritrea.[34] the war resulted in the military occupation of ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of italian east africa (africa orientale italiana, or aoi); in addition it exposed the weakness of the league of nations as a force to preserve peace. both italy and ethiopia were member nations, but the league did little when the former clearly violated article x of the league's covenant.[35] the united kingdom and france supported imposing sanctions on italy for the invasion, but they were not fully enforced and failed to end the italian invasion.[36] italy subsequently dropped its objections to germany's goal of absorbing austria.[37]spanish civil war (1936–1939)main article: spanish civil war the bombing of guernica in 1937, during the spanish civil war, sparked fears abroad europe that the next war would be based on bombing of cities with very high civilian casualtieswhen civil war broke out in spain, hitler and mussolini lent military support to the nationalist rebels, led by general francisco franco. the soviet union supported the existing government, the spanish republic. over 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the international brigades, also fought against the nationalists. both germany and the soviet union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. the nationalists won the civil war in april 1939; franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during world war ii but generally favoured the axis.[38] his greatest collaboration with germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the eastern front.[39]japanese invasion of china (1937)main article: second sino-japanese war japanese imperial army soldiers during the battle of shanghai, 1937in july 1937, japan captured the former chinese imperial capital of peking after instigating the marco polo bridge incident, which culminated in the japanese campaign to invade all of china.[40] the soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with china to lend materiel support, effectively ending china's prior co-operation with germany. from september to november, the japanese attacked taiyuan, engaged the kuomintang army around xinkou,[41] and fought communist forces in pingxingguan.[42][43] generalissimo chiang kai-shek deployed his best army to defend shanghai, but, after three months of fighting, shanghai fell. the japanese continued to push the chinese forces back, capturing the capital nanking in december 1937. after the fall of nanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the japanese.[44][45]in march 1938, nationalist chinese forces won their first major victory at taierzhuang but then the city of xuzhou was taken by japanese in may.[46] in june 1938, chinese forces stalled the japanese advance by flooding the yellow river; this manoeuvre bought time for the chinese to prepare their defences at wuhan, but the city was taken by october.[47] japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of chinese resistance that japan had hoped to achieve; instead the chinese government relocated inland to chongqing and continued the war.[48][49]soviet–japanese border conflictsmain article: soviet–japanese border conflicts red army artillery unit during the battle of lake khasan, 1938in the mid-to-late 1930s, japanese forces in manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the soviet union and mongolia. the japanese doctrine of hokushin-ron, which emphasised japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the imperial army during this time. with the japanese defeat at khalkin gol in 1939, the ongoing second sino-japanese war[50] and ally nazi germany pursuing neutrality with the soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. japan and the soviet union eventually signed a neutrality pact in april 1941, and japan adopted the doctrine of nanshin-ron, promoted by the navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the united states and the western allies.[51][52]european occupations and agreements chamberlain, daladier, hitler, mussolini, and ciano pictured just before signing the munich agreement, 29 september 1938in europe, germany and italy were becoming more aggressive. in march 1938, germany annexed austria, again provoking little response from other european powers.[53] encouraged, hitler began pressing german claims on the sudetenland, an area of czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic german population. soon the united kingdom and france followed the counsel of british prime minister neville chamberlain and conceded this territory to germany in the munich agreement, which was made against the wishes of the czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.[54] soon afterwards, germany and italy forced czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to hungary, and poland annexed czechoslovakia's zaolzie region.[55]although all of germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately hitler was furious that british interference had prevented him from seizing all of czechoslovakia in one operation. in subsequent speeches hitler attacked british and jewish "war-mongers" and in january 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the german navy to challenge british naval supremacy. in march 1939, germany invaded the remainder of czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the german protectorate of bohemia and moravia and a pro-german client state, the slovak republic.[56] hitler also delivered the 20 march 1939 ultimatum to lithuania, forcing the concession of the klaipėda region.[57] german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop (right) and the soviet leader joseph stalin, after signing the molotov–ribbentrop pact, 23 august 1939greatly alarmed and with hitler making further demands on the free city of danzig, the united kingdom and france guaranteed their support for polish independence; when italy conquered albania in april 1939, the same guarantee was extended to romania and greece.[58] shortly after the franco-british pledge to poland, germany and italy formalised their own alliance with the pact of steel.[59] hitler accused the united kingdom and poland of trying to "encircle" germany and renounced the anglo-german naval agreement and the german–polish non-aggression pact.[60]the situation reached a general crisis in late august as german troops continued to mobilise against the polish border. in august 23, when tripartite negotiations about a military alliance between france, the united kingdom and soviet union stalled,[61] the soviet union signed a non-aggression pact with germany.[62] this pact had a secret protocol that defined german and soviet "spheres of influence" (western poland and lithuania for germany; eastern poland, finland, estonia, latvia and bessarabia for the soviet union), and raised the question of continuing polish independence.[63] the pact neutralized the possibility of soviet opposition to a campaign against poland and assured that germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in world war i. immediately after that, hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 august, but upon hearing that the united kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland, and that italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.[64]in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, germany made demands on poland, which only served as a pretext to worsen relations.[65] on 29 august, hitler demanded that a polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the handover of danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession.[65] the poles refused to comply with the german demands, and on the night of 30–31 august in a stormy meeting with the british ambassador neville henderson, ribbentrop declared that germany considered its claims rejected.[66]course of the warfurther information: diplomatic history of world war iiwar breaks out in europe (1939–40) soldiers of the german wehrmacht tearing down the border crossing into poland, 1 september 1939on 1 september 1939, germany invaded poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the attack.[67] the battle of westerplatte is often described as the first battle of the war. the united kingdom responded with an ultimatum to germany to cease military operations, and on 3 september, after the ultimatum was ignored, france, the united kingdom, australia, and new zealand declared war on germany. this alliance was joined by south africa (6 september) and canada (10 september). the alliance provided no direct military support to poland, outside of a cautious french probe into the saarland.[68] the western allies also began a naval blockade of germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[69] germany responded by ordering u-boat warfare against allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the battle of the atlantic.[70] soldiers of the polish army during the defence of poland, september 1939on 8 september, german troops reached the suburbs of warsaw. the polish counter offensive to the west halted the german advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the wehrmacht. remnants of the polish army broke through to besieged warsaw. on 17 september 1939, after signing a cease-fire with japan, the soviets invaded eastern poland[71] under a pretext that the polish state had ostensibly ceased to exist.[72] on 27 september, the warsaw garrison surrendered to the germans, and the last large operational unit of the polish army surrendered on 6 october. despite the military defeat, the polish government never surrendered.[73] a significant part of polish military personnel evacuated to romania and the baltic countries; many of them would fight against the axis in other theatres of the war.[74] the polish government in exile also established an underground state and a resistance movement; in particular the polish partisan home army would grow to become one of the war's largest resistance movements.[73]germany annexed the western and occupied the central part of poland, and the soviet union annexed its eastern part; small shares of polish territory were transferred to lithuania and slovakia. on 6 october, hitler made a public peace overture to the united kingdom and france, but said that the future of poland was to be determined exclusively by germany and the soviet union. the proposal was rejected,[66] and hitler ordered an immediate offensive against france,[75] which would be postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather.[76][77][78] finnish machine gun nest aimed at soviet red army positions during the winter war, february 1940the soviet union forced the baltic countries—estonia, latvia and lithuania, the states that were in the soviet "sphere of influence" under the molotov-ribbentrop pact—to sign "mutual assistance pacts" that stipulated stationing soviet troops in these countries. soon after, significant soviet military contingents were moved there.[79][80][81] finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the soviet union. the soviet union invaded finland in november 1939,[82] and the soviet union was expelled from the league of nations.[83] despite overwhelming numerical superiority, soviet military success was modest, and the finno-soviet war ended in march 1940 with minimal finnish concessions.[84]in june 1940, the soviet union forcibly annexed estonia, latvia and lithuania,[80] and the disputed romanian regions of bessarabia, northern bukovina and hertza. meanwhile, nazi-soviet political rapprochement and economic co-operation[85][86] gradually stalled,[87][88] and both states began preparations for war.[89]western europe

denmark and norway to protect shipments of iron ore from sweden, which the allies were attempting to cut off.[90] denmark capitulated after a few hours, and norway was conquered within two months[91] despite allied support. british discontent over the norwegian campaign led to the appointment of winston churchill as prime minister on 10 may 1940.[92]on the same day, germany launched an offensive against france. to circumvent the strong maginot line fortifications on the franco-german border, germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of belgium, the netherlands, and luxembourg.[93] the germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the ardennes region,[94] which was mistakenly perceived by allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.[95][96] by successfully implementing new blitzkrieg tactics, the wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the channel and cut off the allied forces in belgium, trapping the bulk of the allied armies in a cauldron on the franco-belgian border near lille. the united kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of allied troops from the continent by early june, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.[97]on 10 june, italy invaded france, declaring war on both france and the united kingdom.[98] the germans turned south against the weakened french army, and paris fell to them on 14 june. eight days later france signed an armistice with germany; it was divided into german and italian occupation zones,[99] and an unoccupied rump state under the vichy regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with germany. france kept its fleet, which the united kingdom attacked on 3 july in an attempt to prevent its seizure by germany.[100] london seen from st. paul's cathedral after the german blitz, 29 december 1940the battle of britain[101] began in early july with luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours.[102] the united kingdom rejected hitler's ultimatum,[103] and the german air superiority campaign started in august but failed to defeat raf fighter command. due to this the proposed german invasion of britain was postponed indefinitely on 17 september. the german strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on london and other cities in the blitz, but failed to significantly disrupt the british war effort[102] and largely ended in may 1941.[104]using newly captured french ports, the german navy enjoyed success against an over-extended royal navy, using u-boats against british shipping in the atlantic.[105] the british home fleet scored a significant victory on 27 may 1941 by sinking the german battleship bismarck.[106]in november 1939, the united states was taking measures to assist china and the western allies, and amended the neutrality act to allow "cash and carry" purchases by the allies.[107] in 1940, following the german capture of paris, the size of the united states navy was significantly increased. in september the united states further agreed to a trade of american destroyers for british bases.[108] still, a large majority of the american public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.[109] in december 1940 roosevelt accused hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the united states to become an "arsenal of democracy" and promoting lend-lease programmes of aid to support the british war effort.[103] the united states started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against germany.[110]at the end of september 1940, the tripartite pact formally united japan, italy and germany as the axis powers. the tripartite pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the soviet union, which attacked any axis power would be forced to go to war against all three.[111] the axis expanded in november 1940 when hungary, slovakia and romania joined.[112] romania and hungary would make major contributions to the axis war against the soviet union, in romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the soviet union.[113]mediterranean (1940–41)main article: mediterranean and middle east theatre of world war ii soldiers of the british commonwealth forces from the australian army's 9th division during the siege of tobruk; north african campaign, august 1941in early june 1940 the italian regia aeronautica attacked and besieged malta, a british possession. in late summer through early autumn italy conquered british somaliland and made an incursion into british-held egypt. in october italy attacked greece, but the attack was repulsed with heavy italian casualties; the campaign ended within days with minor territorial changes.[114] germany started preparation for an invasion of the balkans to assist italy, to prevent the british from gaining a foothold there, which would be a potential threat for romanian oil fields, and to strike against the british dominance of the mediterranean.[115]in december 1940, british empire forces began counter-offensives against italian forces in egypt and italian east africa.[116] the offensives were highly successful; by early february 1941 italy had lost control of eastern libya, and large numbers of italian troops had been taken prisoner. the italian navy also suffered significant defeats, with the royal navy putting three italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at taranto and neutralising several more warships at the battle of cape matapan.[117] german panzers of the afrika korps advancing across the north african desert, 1941italian defeats prompted germany to deploy an expeditionary force to north africa, and at the end of march 1941 rommel's afrika korps launched an offensive which drove back the commonwealth forces.[118] in under a month, axis forces advanced to western egypt and besieged the port of tobruk.[119]by late march 1941 bulgaria and yugoslavia signed the tripartite pact. however, the yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by pro-british nationalists. germany responded with simultaneous invasions of both yugoslavia and greece, commencing on 6 april 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month.[120] the airborne invasion of the greek island of crete at the end of may completed the german conquest of the balkans.[121] although the axis victory was swift, bitter and large-scale partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the axis occupation of yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.[122]in the middle east, in may commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in iraq which had been supported by german aircraft from bases within vichy-controlled syria.[123] between june and july they invaded and occupied the french possessions syria and lebanon, with the assistance of the free french.[citation needed]axis attack on the soviet union (1941)main article: eastern front (world war ii) european theatre of world war ii animation map, 1939–1945 — red: western allies and soviet union after 1941; green: soviet union before 1941; blue: axis powerswith the situation in europe and asia relatively stable, germany, japan, and the soviet union made preparations. with the soviets wary of mounting tensions with germany and the japanese planning to take advantage of the european war by seizing resource-rich european possessions in southeast asia, the two powers signed the soviet–japanese neutrality pact in april 1941.[124] by contrast, the germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the soviet union, massing forces on the soviet border.[125]hitler believed that the united kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the united states and the soviet union would enter the war against germany sooner or later.[126] he therefore decided to try to strengthen germany's relations with the soviets, or failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor. in november 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the soviet union would join the tripartite pact. the soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from finland, bulgaria, turkey, and japan that germany considered unacceptable. on 18 december 1940, hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the soviet union.[127] german soldiers during the invasion of the soviet union by the axis powers, 1941on 22 june 1941, germany, supported by italy and romania, invaded the soviet union in operation barbarossa, with germany accusing the soviets of plotting against them. they were joined shortly by finland and hungary.[128] the primary targets of this surprise offensive[129] were the baltic region, moscow and ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the arkhangelsk-astrakhan line, from the caspian to the white seas. hitler's objectives were to eliminate the soviet union as a military power, exterminate communism, generate lebensraum ("living space")[130] by dispossessing the native population[131] and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat germany's remaining rivals.[132]although the red army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war,[133] barbarossa forced the soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence. during the summer, the axis made significant gains into soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. by the middle of august, however, the german army high command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted army group centre, and to divert the 2nd panzer group to reinforce troops advancing towards central ukraine and leningrad.[134] the kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four soviet armies, and made possible further advance into crimea and industrially developed eastern ukraine (the first battle of kharkov).[135] soviet civilians leaving destroyed houses after a german bombardment during the battle of leningrad, 10 december 1942the diversion of three quarters of the axis troops and the majority of their air forces from france and the central mediterranean to the eastern front[136] prompted the united kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy.[137] in july, the uk and the soviet union formed a military alliance against germany[138] the british and soviets invaded neutral iran to secure the persian corridor and iran's oil fields.[139] in august, the united kingdom and the united states jointly issued the atlantic charter.[140]by october axis operational objectives in ukraine and the baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of leningrad[141] and sevastopol continuing.[142] a major offensive against moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the german army almost reached the outer suburbs of moscow, where the exhausted troops[143] were forced to suspend their offensive.[144] large territorial gains were made by axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in soviet hands, the soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the soviet union retained a considerable part of its military potential. the blitzkrieg phase of the war in europe had ended.[145]by early december, freshly mobilised reserves[146] allowed the soviets to achieve numerical parity with axis troops.[147] this, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of soviet troops in the east would be sufficient to deter any attack by the japanese kwantung army,[148] allowed the soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 december all along the front and pushed german troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west.[149]war breaks out in the pacific (1941)main article: pacific warin 1939, the united states had renounced its trade treaty with japan, and beginning with an aviation gasoline ban in july 1940, japan became subject to increasing economic pressure.[103] during this time, japan launched its first attack against changsha, a strategically important chinese city, but was repulsed by late september.[150] despite several offensives by both sides, the war between china and japan was stalemated by 1940. to increase pressure on china by blocking supply routes, and to better position japanese forces in the event of a war with the western powers, japan invaded and occupied northern indochina.[151] afterwards, the united states embargoed iron, steel and mechanical parts against japan.[152]chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. in august, chinese communists launched an offensive in central china; in retaliation, japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.[153] continued antipathy between chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in january 1941, effectively ending their co-operation.[154] in march, the japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the chinese 19th army but was repulsed during battle of shanggao.[155] in september, japan attempted to take the city of changsha again and clashed with chinese nationalist forces.[156] mitsubishi a6m2 "zero" fighters on the imperial japanese navy aircraft carrier shōkaku, just before the attack on pearl harborgerman successes in europe encouraged japan to increase pressure on european governments in southeast asia. the dutch government agreed to provide japan some oil supplies from the dutch east indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in june 1941.[157] in july 1941 japan sent troops to southern indochina, thus threatening british and dutch possessions in the far east. the united states, united kingdom and other western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on japanese assets and a total oil embargo.[158][159] at the same time, japan was planning an invasion of the soviet far east, intending to capitalise off the german invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.[160]since early 1941 the united states and japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in china. during these negotiations japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the americans as inadequate.[161] at the same time the united states, the united kingdom, and the netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a japanese attack against any of them.[162] roosevelt reinforced the philippines (an american protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned japan that the united states would react to japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries".[162] the uss arizona was a total loss in the japanese surprise air attack on the american pacific fleet at pearl harbor, 7 december 1941frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the american-british-dutch sanctions, japan prepared for war. on 20 november a new government under hideki tojo presented an interim proposal as its final offer. it called for the end of american aid to china and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to japan. in exchange japan promised not to launch any attacks in southeast asia and to withdraw its forces from southern indochina.[161] the american counter-proposal of 26 november required that japan evacuate all of china without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all pacific powers.[163] that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force;[164][165] the japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.[166]japan planned to rapidly seize european colonies in asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the central pacific. the japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of southeast asia while exhausting the over-stretched allies by fighting a defensive war.[167][168] to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset.[169] on 7 december 1941 (8 december in asian time zones), japan attacked british and american holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific.[170] these included an attack on the american fleets at pearl harbor and the philippines, landings in thailand and malaya,[170] and the battle of hong kong.[citation needed]these attacks led the united states, united kingdom, china, australia and several other states to formally declare war on japan, whereas the soviet union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with european axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with japan.[171] germany, followed by the other axis states, declared war on the united states[172] in solidarity with japan, citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been ordered by roosevelt.[128][173]axis advance stalls (1942–43) us president franklin d. roosevelt and british pm winston churchill seated at the casablanca conference, january 1943on 1 january 1942, the allied big four[174]—the soviet union, china, the united kingdom and the united states—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration by united nations, thereby affirming the atlantic charter,[175] and agreeing to not to sign a separate peace with the axis powers.[176]during 1942, allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. all agreed that defeating germany was the primary objective. the americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on germany through france. the soviets were also demanding a second front. the british, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out german strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. an offensive against germany would then be launched primarily by allied armour without using large-scale armies.[177] eventually, the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa.[178]at the casablanca conference in early 1943, the allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 declaration, and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading sicily to fully secure the mediterranean supply routes.[179] although the british argued for further operations in the balkans to bring turkey into the war, in may 1943, the americans extracted a british commitment to limit allied operations in the mediterranean to an invasion of the italian mainland and to invade france in 1944.[180]pacific (1942–43) map of japanese military advances through mid-1942by the end of april 1942, japan and its ally thailand had almost fully conquered burma, malaya, the dutch east indies, singapore, and rabaul, inflicting severe losses on allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.[181] despite stubborn resistance by filipino and us forces, the philippine commonwealth was eventually captured in may 1942, forcing its government into exile.[182] on 16 april, in burma, 7,000 british soldiers were encircled by the japanese 33rd division during the battle of yenangyaung and rescued by the chinese 38th division.[183] japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the south china sea, java sea and indian ocean,[184] and bombed the allied naval base at darwin, australia. in january 1942, the only allied success against japan was a chinese victory at changsha.[185] these easy victories over unprepared us and european opponents left japan overconfident, as well as overextended.[186]in early may 1942, japan initiated operations to capture port moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the united states and australia. the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force, centred on two american fleet carriers, fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea.[187] japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier doolittle raid, was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska.[188] in mid-may, japan started the zhejiang-jiangxi campaign in china, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the chinese 23rd and 32nd army groups.[189][190] in early june, japan put its operations into action, but the americans, having broken japanese naval codes in late may, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy.[191] us marines during the guadalcanal campaign, in the pacific theatre, 1942with its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the midway battle, japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture port moresby by an overland campaign in the territory of papua.[192] the americans planned a counter-attack against japanese positions in the southern solomon islands, primarily guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing rabaul, the main japanese base in southeast asia.[193]both plans started in july, but by mid-september, the battle for guadalcanal took priority for the japanese, and troops in new guinea were ordered to withdraw from the port moresby area to the northern part of the island, where they faced australian and united states troops in the battle of buna-gona.[194] guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for guadalcanal. by the start of 1943, the japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.[195] in burma, commonwealth forces mounted two operations. the first, an offensive into the arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to india by may 1943.[196] the second was the insertion of irregular forces behind japanese front-lines in february which, by the end of april, had achieved mixed results.[197]eastern front (1942–43) red army soldiers on the counterattack during the battle of stalingrad, february 1943despite considerable losses, in early 1942 germany and its allies stopped a major soviet offensive in central and southern russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.[198] in may the germans defeated soviet offensives in the kerch peninsula and at kharkov,[199] and then launched their main summer offensive against southern russia in june 1942, to seize the oil fields of the caucasus and occupy kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. the germans split army group south into two groups: army group a advanced to the lower don river and struck south-east to the caucasus, while army group b headed towards the volga river. the soviets decided to make their stand at stalingrad on the volga.[200]by mid-november, the germans had nearly taken stalingrad in bitter street fighting. the soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of german forces at stalingrad,[201] and an assault on the rzhev salient near moscow, though the latter failed disastrously.[202] by early february 1943, the german army had taken tremendous losses; german troops at stalingrad had been forced to surrender,[203] and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. in mid-february, after the soviet push had tapered off, the germans launched another attack on kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the soviet city of kursk.[204]western europe/atlantic and mediterranean (1942–43) american 8th air force boeing b-17 flying fortress bombing raid

commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, operation crusader, in north africa, and reclaimed all the gains the germans and italians had made.[206] in north africa, the germans launched an offensive in january, pushing the british back to positions at the gazala line by early february,[207] followed by a temporary lull in combat which germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.[208] concerns the japanese might use bases in vichy-held madagascar caused the british to invade the island in early may 1942.[209] an axis offensive in libya forced an allied retreat deep inside egypt until axis forces were stopped at el alamein.[210] on the continent, raids of allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous dieppe raid,[211] demonstrated the western allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.[212][page needed]in august 1942, the allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against el alamein[213] and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged malta.[214] a few months later, the allies commenced an attack of their own in egypt, dislodging the axis forces and beginning a drive west across libya.[215] this attack was followed up shortly after by anglo-american landings in french north africa, which resulted in the region joining the allies.[216] hitler responded to the french colony's defection by ordering the occupation of vichy france;[216] although vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by german forces.[216][217] the axis forces in africa withdrew into tunisia, which was conquered by the allies in may 1943.[216][218]in june 1943 the british and americans began a strategic bombing campaign against germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and "de-house" the civilian population.[219] the firebombing of hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.[220]allies gain momentum (1943–44) u.s. navy sbd-5 scout plane flies patrol over uss washington and uss lexington during the gilbert and marshall islands campaign, 1943after the guadalcanal campaign, the allies initiated several operations against japan in the pacific. in may 1943, canadian and us forces were sent to eliminate japanese forces from the aleutians.[221] soon after, the united states, with support from australian and new zealand forces, began major operations to isolate rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the japanese central pacific perimeter at the gilbert and marshall islands.[222] by the end of march 1944, the allies had completed both of these objectives, and had also neutralised the major japanese base at truk in the caroline islands. in april, the allies launched an operation to retake western new guinea.[223]in the soviet union, both the germans and the soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central russia. on 4 july 1943, germany attacked soviet forces around the kursk bulge. within a week, german forces had exhausted themselves against the soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences,[224] and for the first time in the war hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.[225] this decision was partially affected by the western allies' invasion of sicily launched on 9 july, which, combined with previous italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of mussolini later that month.[226] red army troops in a counter-offensive on german positions at the battle of kursk, july 1943on 12 july 1943, the soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling any chance of german victory or even stalemate in the east. the soviet victory at kursk marked the end of german superiority,[227] giving the soviet union the initiative on the eastern front.[228][229] the germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified panther–wotan line, but the soviets broke through it at smolensk and by the lower dnieper offensives.[230]on 3 september 1943, the western allies invaded the italian mainland, following italy's armistice with the allies.[231] germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of italian areas,[232] and creating a series of defensive lines.[233] german special forces then rescued mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in german-occupied italy named the italian social republic,[234] causing an italian civil war. the western allies fought through several lines until reaching the main german defensive line in mid-november.[235]german operations in the atlantic also suffered. by may 1943, as allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable german submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the german atlantic naval campaign.[236] in november 1943, franklin d. roosevelt and winston churchill met with chiang kai-shek in cairo and then with joseph stalin in tehran.[237] the former conference determined the post-war return of japanese territory[238] and the military planning for the burma campaign,[239] while the latter included agreement that the western allies would invade europe in 1944 and that the soviet union would declare war on japan within three months of germany's defeat.[240] ruins of the benedictine monastery, during the battle of monte cassino, italian campaign, may 1944from november 1943, during the seven-week battle of changde, the chinese forced japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting allied relief.[241][242][243] in january 1944, the allies launched a series of attacks in italy against the line at monte cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at anzio.[244]on 27 january 1944, soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled german forces from the leningrad region, thereby ending the longest and most lethal siege in history.[245] the following soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war estonian border by the german army group north aided by estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. this delay slowed subsequent soviet operations in the baltic sea region.[246] by late may 1944, the soviets had liberated crimea, largely expelled axis forces from ukraine, and made incursions into romania, which were repulsed by the axis troops.[247] the allied offensives in italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several german divisions to retreat, on 4 june, rome was captured.[248]the allies had mixed success in mainland asia. in march 1944, the japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against british positions in assam, india,[249] and soon besieged commonwealth positions at imphal and kohima.[250] in may 1944, british forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove japanese troops back to burma,[250] and chinese forces that had invaded northern burma in late 1943 besieged japanese troops in myitkyina.[251] the second japanese invasion of china aimed to destroy china's main fighting forces, secure railways between japanese-held territory and capture allied airfields.[252] by june, the japanese had conquered the province of henan and begun a new attack on changsha in the hunan province.[253]allies close in (1944) american troops approaching omaha beach, during the invasion of normandy on d-day, 6 june 1944on 6 june 1944 (known as d-day), after three years of soviet pressure,[254] the western allies invaded northern france. after reassigning several allied divisions from italy, they also attacked southern france.[255] these landings were successful, and led to the defeat of the german army units in france. paris was liberated on 25 august by the local resistance assisted by the free french forces, both led by general charles de gaulle,[256] and the western allies continued to push back german forces in western europe during the latter part of the year. an attempt to advance into northern germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the netherlands failed.[257] after that, the western allies slowly pushed into germany, but failed to cross the ruhr river in a large offensive. in italy, allied advance also slowed due to the last major german defensive line.[258] german ss soldiers from the dirlewanger brigade, tasked with suppressing the warsaw uprising against nazi occupation, august 1944on 22 june, the soviets launched a strategic offensive in belarus ("operation bagration") that destroyed the german army group centre almost completely.[259] soon after that, another soviet strategic offensive forced german troops from western ukraine and eastern poland. the soviet advance prompted resistance forces in poland to initiate several uprisings against the german occupation. however, the largest of these, in warsaw and a national uprising in slovakia, did not receive soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the germans.[260] the red army's strategic offensive in eastern romania cut off and destroyed the considerable german troops there and triggered a successful coup d'état in romania and in bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to the allied side.[261]in september 1944, soviet troops advanced into yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of german army groups e and f in greece, albania and yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.[262] by this point, the communist-led partisans under marshal josip broz tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against german forces further south. in northern serbia, the red army, with limited support from bulgarian forces, assisted the partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of belgrade on 20 october. a few days later, the soviets launched a massive assault against german-occupied hungary that lasted until the fall of budapest in february 1945.[263] unlike impressive soviet victories in the balkans, bitter finnish resistance to the soviet offensive in the karelian isthmus denied the soviets occupation of finland and led to a soviet-finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions,[264] although finland was forced to fight their former allies.[265] general douglas macarthur returns to the philippines, during the battle of leyte, 20 october 1944by the start of july 1944, commonwealth forces in southeast asia had repelled the japanese sieges in assam, pushing the japanese back to the chindwin river[266] while the chinese captured myitkyina. in september 1944, chinese force captured the mount song to reopen the burma road.[267] in china, the japanese had more successes, having finally captured changsha in mid-june and the city of hengyang by early august.[268] soon after, they invaded the province of guangxi, winning major engagements against chinese forces at guilin and liuzhou by the end of november[269] and successfully linking up their forces in china and indochina by mid-december.[270]in the pacific, us forces continued to press back the japanese perimeter. in mid-june 1944, they began their offensive against the mariana and palau islands, and decisively defeated japanese forces in the battle of the philippine sea. these defeats led to the resignation of the japanese prime minister, hideki tojo, and provided the united states with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the japanese home islands. in late october, american forces invaded the filipino island of leyte; soon after, allied naval forces scored another large victory in the battle of leyte gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.[271]axis collapse, allied victory (1944–45) yalta conference held in february 1945, with winston churchill, franklin d. roosevelt and joseph stalinon 16 december 1944, germany made a last attempt on the western front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the ardennes and along the french–german border to split the western allies, encircle large portions of western allied troops and capture their primary supply port at antwerp to prompt a political settlement.[272] by january, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.[272] in italy, the western allies remained stalemated at the german defensive line. in mid-january 1945, the soviets and poles attacked in poland, pushing from the vistula to the oder river in germany, and overran east prussia.[273] on 4 february, soviet, british and us leaders met for the yalta conference. they agreed on the occupation of post-war germany, and on when the soviet union would join the war against japan.[274]in february, the soviets entered silesia and pomerania, while western allies entered western germany and closed to the rhine river. by march, the western allies crossed the rhine north and south of the ruhr, encircling the german army group b.[275] in early march, in attempts to protect her last oil reserves in hungary and to retake budapest, germany launched the last major offensive, that was directed against soviet troops near the lake balaton. it two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the soviets advanced to vienna, and captured the city. in early april, soviet troops captured königsberg, while the western allies finally pushed forward in italy and swept across western germany capturing hamburg and nuremberg. american and soviet forces met at the elbe river on 25 april, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern germany and around berlin. the german reichstag after its capture by the allied forces, 3 june 1945soviet and polish forces stormed and captured berlin in late april. in italy, german forces surrendered on 29 april. on 30 april, the reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of nazi germany,[276] berlin garrison surrendered on 2 may.several changes in leadership occurred during this period. on 12 april, president roosevelt died and was succeeded by harry s. truman. benito mussolini was killed by italian partisans on 28 april.[277] two days later, hitler committed suicide in besieged berlin, and he was succeeded by grand admiral karl dönitz.[278]total and unconditional surrender was signed on 7 and 8 may, to be effective by the end of 8 may.[279] german army group centre resisted in prague until 11 may.[280]in the pacific theatre, american forces accompanied by the forces of the philippine commonwealth advanced in the philippines, clearing leyte by the end of april 1945. they landed on luzon in january 1945 and recaptured manila in march. fighting continued on luzon, mindanao, and other islands of the philippines until the end of the war.[281] meanwhile, the united states army air forces launched  a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in japan in an effort to destroy japanese war industry and civilian morale. a devastating bombing raid of 9–10 march was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history. japanese foreign affairs minister mamoru shigemitsu signs the japanese instrument of surrender on board uss missouri, 2 september 1945in may 1945, australian troops landed in borneo, over-running the oilfields there. british, american, and chinese forces defeated the japanese in northern burma in march, and the british pushed on to reach rangoon by 3 may.[282] chinese forces started a counterattack in the battle of west hunan that occurred between 6 april and 7 june 1945. american naval and amphibious forces also moved towards japan, taking iwo jima by march, and okinawa by the end of june.[283] at the same time, american submarines cut off japanese imports, drastically reducing japan's ability to supply its overseas forces.[284]on 11 july, allied leaders met in potsdam, germany. they confirmed earlier agreements about germany,[285] and reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of japan, specifically stating that "the alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction".[286] during this conference, the united kingdom held its general election, and clement attlee replaced churchill as prime minister.[287]the allied call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the japanese government, which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms.[288] in early august, the usaaf dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki. between the two bombings, the soviets, pursuant to the yalta agreement, invaded japanese-held manchuria and quickly defeated the kwantung army, which was the largest japanese fighting force,[289] thereby persuading previously adamant imperial army leaders to accept surrender terms.[290] the red army also captured the southern part of sakhalin island and the kuril islands. on 15 august 1945, japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at tokyo bay on the deck of the american battleship uss missouri on 2 september 1945, ending the war.[291]aftermathmain articles: aftermath of world war ii and consequences of nazism ruins of warsaw in january 1945, after the deliberate destruction of the city by the occupying german forcesthe allies established occupation administrations in austria and germany. the former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. the latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union. a denazification programme in germany led to the prosecution of nazi war criminals in the nuremberg trials and the removal of ex-nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-nazis into west german society.[292]germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. among the eastern territories, silesia, neumark and most of pomerania were taken over by poland,[293] and east prussia was divided between poland and the soviet union, followed by the expulsion to germany of the nine million germans from these provinces,[294][295] as well as three million germans from the sudetenland in czechoslovakia. by the 1950s, one-fifth of west germans were refugees from the east. the soviet union also took over the polish provinces east of the curzon line,[296] from which 2 million poles were expelled;[295][297] north-east romania,[298][299] parts of eastern finland,[300] and the three baltic states were incorporated into the soviet union.[301][302] defendants at the nuremberg trials, where the allied forces prosecuted prominent members of the political, military, judicial and economic leadership of nazi germany for crimes against humanityin an effort to maintain world peace,[303] the allies formed the united nations, which officially came into existence on 24 october 1945,[304] and adopted the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations.[305] the great powers that were the victors of the war—france, china, the united kingdom, the soviet union and the united states—became the permanent members of the un's security council.[7] the five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the republic of china and the people's republic of china in 1971, and between the soviet union and its successor state, the russian federation, following the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991. the alliance between the western allies and the soviet union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.[306] post-war border changes in central europe and creation of the eastern blocgermany had been de facto divided, and two independent states, the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic,[307] were created within the borders of allied and soviet occupation zones. the rest of europe was also divided into western and soviet spheres of influence.[308] most eastern and central european countries fell into the soviet sphere, which led to establishment of communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the soviet occupation authorities. as a result, east germany,[309] poland, hungary, romania, czechoslovakia, and albania[310] became soviet satellite states. communist yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the soviet union.[311]post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the united states-led nato and the soviet-led warsaw pact.[312] the long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the cold war, would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars.[313]in asia, the united states led the occupation of japan and administrated japan's former islands in the western pacific, while the soviets annexed sakhalin and the kuril islands.[314] korea, formerly under japanese rule, was divided and occupied by the soviet union in the north and the united states in the south between 1945 and 1948. separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of korea, which led ultimately to the korean war.[315] david ben-gurion proclaiming the israeli declaration of independence at the independence hall, 14 may 1948in china, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in june 1946. communist forces were victorious and established the people's republic of china on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to taiwan in 1949.[316] in the middle east, the arab rejection of the united nations partition plan for palestine and the creation of israel marked the escalation of the arab–israeli conflict. while european powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.[317][318]the global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. the united states emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.[319] the uk and us pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in western germany in the years 1945–1948.[320] because of international trade interdependencies this led to european economic stagnation and delayed european recovery for several years.[321][322]recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in western germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of european economic policy that the marshall plan (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused.[323][324] the post-1948 west german recovery has been called the german economic miracle.[325] italy also experienced an economic boom[326] and the french economy rebounded.[327] by contrast, the united kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,[328] and although receiving a quarter of the total marshall plan assistance, more than any other european country,[329] it continued in relative economic decline for decades.[330]the soviet union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era.[331] japan experienced incredibly rapid economic growth, becoming one of the most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s.[332] china returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952.[333]impactmain article: historiography of world war iicasualties and war crimesmain articles: world war ii casualties and list of war crimes § 1939–1945: world war ii world war ii deathsestimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.[334][335][336]many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and starvation.[citation needed]the soviet union lost around 27 million people during the war,[337] 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths.[338] a quarter of the people in the soviet union were wounded or killed.[339] germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the eastern front and during the final battles in germany.[340]of the total number of deaths in world war ii, approximately 85 per cent—mostly soviet and chinese—were on the allied side.[341] many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by german and japanese forces in occupied territories. an estimated 11[342] to 17 million[343] civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of nazi racist policies, including mass killing of around 6 million jews, along with roma, homosexuals, at least 1.9 million ethnic poles[344][345] and millions of other slavs (including russians, ukrainians and belarusians), and other ethnic and minority groups.[346][343] between 1941 and 1945, over 200,000 ethnic serbs, along with gypsies and jews, were persecuted and murdered by the axis-aligned croatian ustaše in yugoslavia.[347] also, over 100,000 poles were massacred by the ukrainian insurgent army in the volhynia massacres, between 1943 and 1945.[348] at the same time about 10,000–15,000 ukrainians were killed by the polish home army and other polish units, in reprisal attacks.[349] chinese civilians being buried alive by soldiers of the imperial japanese army, during the nanking massacre, december 1937in asia and the pacific, between 3 million and more than 10 million civilians, mostly chinese (estimated at 7.5 million[350]), were killed by the japanese occupation forces.[351] the most infamous japanese atrocity was the nanking massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand chinese civilians were raped and murdered.[352] mitsuyoshi himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the sankō sakusen. general yasuji okamura implemented the policy in heipei and shantung.[353]axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. the imperial japanese army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of china (see unit 731)[354][355] and in early conflicts against the soviets.[356] both the germans and japanese tested such weapons against civilians,[357] and sometimes on prisoners of war.[358]the soviet union was responsible for the katyn massacre of 22,000 polish officers,[359] and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd, along with mass civilian deportations to siberia, in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army.[360]the mass-bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime, although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during world war ii.[361] the usaaf firebombed a total of 67 japanese cities, killing 393,000 civilians and destroying 65% of built-up areas.[362]genocide, concentration camps, and slave labourmain articles: genocide, the holocaust, nazi concentration camps, extermination camp, forced labour under german rule during world war ii, kidnapping of children by nazi germany, and nazi human experimentation schutzstaffel (ss) female camp guards remove prisoners' bodies from lorries and carry them to a mass grave, inside the german bergen-belsen concentration camp, 1945the german government led by adolf hitler and the nazi party was responsible for the holocaust (killing approximately 6 million jews), as well as for killing 2.7 million ethnic poles[363] and 4 million others who were deemed "unworthy of life" (including the disabled and mentally ill, soviet prisoners of war, romani, homosexuals, freemasons, and jehovah's witnesses) as part of a programme of deliberate extermination. soviet pows were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and, although their extermination was not an official goal, 3.6 million soviet pows out of 5.7 died in nazi camps during the war.[364][365] in addition to concentration camps, death camps were created in nazi germany to exterminate people at an industrial scale. nazi germany extensively used forced labourers; about 12 million europeans from german occupied countries were used as a slave work force in german agriculture and war economy.[366]the soviet gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during 1942–43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates,[367] including foreign citizens of poland and other countries occupied in 1939–40 by the soviet union, as well as axis pows.[368] by the end of the war, most soviet pows liberated from nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to nkvd evaluation, and a significant part of them were sent to the gulag as real or perceived nazi collaborators.[369] prisoner identity photograph taken by the german ss of a polish girl deported to auschwitz. approximately 230,000 children were held prisoner, and used in forced labor and medical experiments.japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. the international military tribunal for the far east found the death rate of western prisoners was 27.1 per cent (for american pows, 37 per cent),[370] seven times that of pows under the germans and italians.[371] while 37,583 prisoners from the uk, 28,500 from the netherlands, and 14,473 from the united states were released after the surrender of japan, the number of chinese released was only 56.[372]at least five million chinese civilians from northern china and manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the east asia development board, or kōain, for work in mines and war industries. after 1942, the number reached 10 million.[373] in java, between 4 and 10 million rōmusha (japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work by the japanese military. about 270,000 of these javanese labourers were sent to other japanese-held areas in south east asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to java.[374]occupationmain articles: german-occupied europe, collaboration with the axis powers, resistance during world war ii, and nazi plunder polish civilians wearing blindfolds photographed just before their execution by german soldiers in palmiry forest, 1940in europe, occupation came under two forms. in western, northern, and central europe (france, norway, denmark, the low countries, and the annexed portions of czechoslovakia) germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8 billion us dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.[375] thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total german income as the war went on.[376] soviet partisans hanged by the german army. the russian academy of sciences reported in 1995 civilian victims in the soviet union at german hands totalled 13.7 million dead, twenty percent of the 68 million persons in the occupied soviet union.in the east, the intended gains of lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders.[377] unlike in the west, the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "inferior people" of slavic descent; most german advances were thus followed by mass executions.[378] although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper german operations in either the east[379] or the west[380] until late 1943.in asia, japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere, essentially a japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.[381] although japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from european domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks.[382] during japan's initial conquest it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m3) of oil (~5.5×105 tonnes) left behind by retreating allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the dutch east indies up to 50 million barrels (~6.8×10^6 t), 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate.[382]home fronts and productionmain articles: military production during world war ii and home front during world war ii allied to axis gdp ratioin europe, before the outbreak of the war, the allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. in 1938, the western allies (united kingdom, france, poland and british dominions) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the european axis powers (germany and italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in gdp.[383] in asia at the same time, china had roughly six times the population of japan, but only an 89 per cent higher gdp; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher gdp if japanese colonies are included.[383]the united states provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.[384] though the allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the united states and soviet union joined the allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition.[385] while the allies' ability to out-produce the axis is often attributed to the allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as germany and japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force,[386] allied strategic bombing,[387] and germany's late shift to a war economy[388] contributed significantly. additionally, neither germany nor japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so.[389] to improve their production, germany and japan used millions of slave labourers;[390] germany used about 12 million people, mostly from eastern europe,[366] while japan used more than 18 million people in far east asia.[373][374]advances in technology and warfaremain article: technology during world war ii b-29 superfortress strategic bombers on the boeing assembly line in wichita, kansas, 1944aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was advanced considerably. innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);[391] and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).[392] anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery. the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.[393] although guided missiles were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably target aircraft until some years after the war.advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at taranto, pearl harbor, and the coral sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.[394][395][396] in the atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the mid-atlantic gap.[397] carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft[398] and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.[399] submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war,[400] were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. the british focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics.[401] gradually, improving allied technologies such as the leigh light, hedgehog, squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious.[citation needed] a v-2 rocket launched from a fixed site in peenemünde, 21 june 1943land warfare changed from the static front lines of trench warfare of world war i, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms. the tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the first world war, had evolved into the primary weapon.[402] in the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world war i,[403] and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.[citation needed] at the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.[404] this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and german doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. this, along with germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across poland and france.[402] many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.[404] even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,[405] and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to world war i.[406] the portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the german mg34, and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings.[406] the assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.[407] nuclear gadget being raised to the top of the detonation "shot tower", at alamogordo bombing range; trinity nuclear test, new mexico, july 1945most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the german enigma machine.[408] development of sigint (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. notable examples were the allied decryption of japanese naval codes[409] and british ultra, a pioneering method for decoding enigma benefiting from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau, which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war.[410] another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the allies used to great effect, such as in operations mincemeat and bodyguard.[409][411]other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (z3, colossus, and eniac), guided missiles and modern rockets, the manhattan project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the english channel.[citation needed]see alsoair warfare of world war iibibliography of world war iideclarations of war during world war iihistoriography

classwound badgeadolf hitler (german: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] (listen); 20 april 1889 – 30 april 1945) was a german politician and leader of the nazi party (nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei; nsdap). he rose to power to become dictator of germany, serving as chancellor from 1933 and führer ("leader") from 1934.[a] during his dictatorship from 1933 to 1945, he initiated world war ii in europe  by invading poland in september 1939. he closely supervised military operations during the war and by december 1941 had full control of all strategic decisions, especially on the eastern front. he was central to the perpetration of the holocaust. hitler was born in austria—then part of austria-hungary—and was raised near linz. he moved to germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the german army in world war i. in 1919, he joined the german workers' party (dap), the precursor of the nsdap, and was appointed leader of the nsdap in 1921. in 1923, he attempted to seize power in a failed coup in munich and was imprisoned. in jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto mein kampf ("my struggle"). after his release in 1924, hitler gained popular support by attacking the treaty of versailles and promoting pan-germanism, anti-semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and nazi propaganda. he frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a jewish conspiracy.by july 1932 the nazi party was the largest elected party in the german reichstag, but did not have a majority, and no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. former chancellor franz von papen and other conservative leaders persuaded president paul von hindenburg to appoint hitler as chancellor on 30 january 1933. shortly after, the reichstag passed the enabling act of 1933, which began the process of transforming the weimar republic into nazi germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of national socialism. hitler aimed to eliminate jews from germany and establish a new order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-world war i international order dominated by britain and france. his first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the great depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on germany after world war i, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic germans, which gave him significant popular support.hitler sought lebensraum ("living space") for the german people in eastern europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of world war ii in europe. he directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 september 1939, invaded poland, resulting in britain and france declaring war on germany. in june 1941, hitler ordered an invasion of the soviet union. by the end of 1941, german forces and the european axis powers occupied most of europe and north africa. in december 1941, shortly after japan attacked pearl harbour, hitler declared war on the united states, bringing it directly into the conflict. failure to defeat the soviets and the entry of the united states into the war forced germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. in the final days of the war, during the battle of berlin in 1945, he married his longtime lover eva braun. less than two days later, on 30 april 1945, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the soviet red army; their corpses were burned.under hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. hitler and the nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. in addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the european theatre. the number of civilians killed during world war ii was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.contents1 ancestry2 early years2.1 childhood and education2.2 early adulthood in vienna and munich2.3 world war i3 entry into politics3.1 beer

(1837–1903) was the illegitimate child of maria anna schicklgruber.[3] the baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and alois initially bore his mother's surname schicklgruber. in 1842, johann georg hiedler married alois's mother maria anna. alois was brought up in the family of hiedler's brother, johann nepomuk hiedler.[4] in 1876, alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register johann georg hiedler as alois's father (recorded as "georg hitler").[5][6] alois then assumed the surname "hitler",[6] also spelled hiedler, hüttler, or huettler. the name is probably based on "one who lives in a hut" (german hütte for "hut").[7]nazi official hans frank suggested that alois's mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a jewish family in graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son leopold frankenberger had fathered alois.[8] no frankenberger was registered in graz during that period, and no record has been produced of leopold frankenberger's existence,[9] so historians dismiss the claim that alois's father was jewish.[10][11]early yearschildhood and education adolf hitler as an infant (c. 1889–90)adolf hitler was born on 20 april 1889 in braunau am inn, a town in austria-hungary (in present-day austria), close to the border with the german empire.[12] he was christened as "adolphus hitler".[13] he was the fourth of six children born to alois hitler and his third wife, klara pölzl. three of hitler's siblings—gustav, ida, and otto—died in infancy.[14] also living in the household were alois's children from his second marriage: alois jr. (born 1882) and angela (born 1883).[15] when hitler was three, the family moved to passau, germany.[16] there he acquired the distinctive lower bavarian dialect, rather than austrian german, which marked his speech throughout his life.[17][18][19] the family returned to austria and settled in leonding in 1894, and in june 1895 alois retired to hafeld, near lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. hitler attended volksschule (a state-owned primary school) in nearby fischlham.[20][21]the move to hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.[22] his father beat him, although his mother tried to protect him.[23] alois hitler's farming efforts at hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to lambach. the eight-year-old hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.[24] in 1898 the family returned permanently to leonding. hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.[25]@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti>.thumbinner{width:100%!important;max-width:none!important}.mw-parser-output .tmulti

wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.[26] hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.[27][28][29] ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, alois sent hitler to the realschule in linz in september 1900.[b][30] hitler rebelled against this decision, and in mein kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw "what little progress i was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream".[31]like many austrian germans, hitler began to develop german nationalist ideas from a young age.[32] he expressed loyalty only to germany, despising the declining habsburg monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire.[33][34] hitler and his friends used the greeting "heil", and sang the "deutschlandlied" instead of the austrian imperial anthem.[35]after alois's sudden death on 3 january 1903, hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave.[36] he enrolled at the realschule in steyr in september 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.[37] in 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.[38]early adulthood in vienna and munich the house in leonding in austria where hitler spent his early adolescence (photo taken in july 2012)in 1907 hitler left linz to live and study fine art in vienna, financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother. he applied for admission to the academy of fine arts vienna but was rejected twice.[39][40] the director suggested hitler should apply to the school of architecture, but he lacked the necessary academic credentials because he had not finished secondary school.[41]on 21 december 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47. in 1909 hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and a men's dormitory.[42][43] he earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of vienna's sights.[39] the alter hof in munich. watercolour by adolf hitler, 1914during his time in vienna he pursued a growing passion for two interests, architecture and music, attending ten performances of lohengrin, his favourite wagner opera.[44]it was here that hitler first became exposed to racist rhetoric.[45] populists such as mayor karl lueger exploited the climate of virulent anti-semitism and occasionally espoused german nationalist notions for political effect. german nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the mariahilf district, where hitler lived.[46] georg ritter von schönerer became a major influence on hitler.[47] he also developed an admiration for martin luther.[48] hitler read local newspapers such as deutsches volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on christian fears of being swamped by an influx of eastern european jews.[49] he read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as houston stewart chamberlain, charles darwin, friedrich nietzsche, gustave le bon and arthur schopenhauer.[50]the origin and development of hitler's anti-semitism remains a matter of debate.[51] his friend, august kubizek, claimed that hitler was a "confirmed anti-semite" before he left linz.[52] however, historian brigitte hamann describes kubizek's claim as "problematical".[53] while hitler states in mein kampf that he first became an anti-semite in vienna,[54] reinhold hanisch, who helped him sell his paintings, disagrees. hitler had dealings with jews while living in vienna.[55][56][57] historian richard j. evans states that "historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-semitism emerged well after germany's defeat [in world war i], as a product of the paranoid "stab-in-the-back" explanation for the catastrophe".[58]hitler received the final part of his father's estate in may 1913 and moved to munich, germany.[59] hitler was called up for conscription into the austro-hungarian army,[60] so he journeyed to salzburg on 5 february 1914 for medical assessment. after he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to munich.[61] hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the habsburg empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of austria-hungary was imminent.[62]world war imain article: military career of adolf hitler hitler (far right, seated) with his army comrades of the bavarian reserve infantry regiment 16 (c. 1914–18)in august 1914, at the outbreak of world war i, hitler was living in munich and voluntarily enlisted in the bavarian army.[63] according to a 1924 report by the bavarian authorities, allowing hitler to serve was almost certainly an administrative error, since as an austrian citizen, he should have been returned to austria.[63] posted to the bavarian reserve infantry regiment 16 (1st company of the list regiment),[64][63] he served as a dispatch runner on the western front in france and belgium,[65] spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in fournes-en-weppes, well behind the front lines.[66][67] he was present at the first battle of ypres, the battle of the somme, the battle of arras, and the battle of passchendaele, and was wounded at the somme.[68] he was decorated for bravery, receiving the iron cross, second class, in 1914.[68] on a recommendation by lieutenant hugo gutmann, hitler's jewish superior, he received the iron cross, first class on 4 august 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of hitler's gefreiter rank.[69][70] he received the black wound badge on 18 may 1918.[71]during his service at headquarters, hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper. during the battle of the somme in october 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout.[72] hitler spent almost two months in hospital at beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 march 1917.[73] on 15 october 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in pasewalk.[74] while there, hitler learned of germany's defeat, and—by his own account—upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.[75]hitler described the war as "the greatest of all experiences", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.[76] his wartime experience reinforced his german patriotism and he was shocked by germany's capitulation in november 1918.[77] his bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.[78] like other german nationalists, he believed the dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the german army, "undefeated in the field", had been "stabbed in the back" on the home front by civilian leaders, jews, marxists, and those who signed the armistice that ended the fighting – later dubbed the "november criminals".[79]the treaty of versailles stipulated that germany must relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the rhineland. the treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. many germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation—they especially objected to article 231, which they interpreted as declaring germany responsible for the war.[80] the versailles treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in germany after the war were later exploited by hitler for political gain.[81]entry into politicsmain article: political views of adolf hitler hitler's german workers' party (dap) membership cardafter world war i, hitler returned to munich.[82] without formal education or career prospects, he remained in the army.[83] in july 1919 he was appointed verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the german workers' party (dap). at a dap meeting on 12 september 1919, party chairman anton drexler was impressed with hitler's oratorical skills. he gave him a copy of his pamphlet my political awakening, which contained anti-semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-marxist ideas.[84] on the orders of his army superiors, hitler applied to join the party,[85] and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).[86][87]around this time, hitler made his earliest known recorded statement about the jews in a letter (now known as the gemlich letter) dated 16 september 1919 to adolf gemlich about the jewish question. in the letter, hitler argues that the aim of the government "must unshakably be the removal of the jews altogether".[88]at the dap, hitler met dietrich eckart, one of the party's founders and a member of the occult thule society.[89] eckart became hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of munich society.[90] to increase its appeal, the dap changed its name to the nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei (national socialist german workers party; nsdap).[91] hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.[92]hitler was discharged from the army on 31 march 1920 and began working full-time for the nsdap.[93] the party headquarters was in munich, a hotbed of anti-government german nationalists determined to crush marxism and undermine the weimar republic.[94] in february 1921—already highly effective at crowd manipulation—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.[95] to publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the treaty of versailles, rival politicians, and especially against marxists and jews.[96] hitler poses for the camera, 1930in june 1921, while hitler and eckart were on a fundraising trip to berlin, a mutiny broke out within the nsdap in munich. members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival german socialist party (dsp).[97] hitler returned to munich on 11 july and angrily tendered his resignation. the committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.[98] hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in munich.[99] the committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 july as member 3,680. hitler continued to face some opposition within the nsdap: opponents of hitler in the leadership had hermann esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking hitler as a traitor to the party.[99][c] in the following days, hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and esser, to thunderous applause. his strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 july, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing drexler, by a vote of 533 to 1.[100]hitler's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. a demagogue,[101] he became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners' economic hardships.[102][103][104] hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking.[105][106] historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of his eyes in small groups.[107] algis budrys recalled the crowd noise and behaviour when hitler appeared in a 1936 parade; some in the audience writhed and rolled on the ground or experienced fecal incontinence.[108] alfons heck, a former member of the hitler youth, recalled a similar experience:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}we erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria. for minutes on end, we shouted at the top of our lungs, with tears streaming down our faces: sieg heil, sieg heil, sieg heil! from that moment on, i belonged to adolf hitler body and soul.[109]early followers included rudolf hess, former air force ace hermann göring, and army captain ernst röhm. röhm became head of the nazis' paramilitary organisation, the sturmabteilung (sa, "stormtroopers"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. a critical influence on hitler's thinking during this period was the aufbau vereinigung,[110] a conspiratorial group of white russian exiles and early national socialists. the group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced hitler to the idea of a jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with bolshevism.[111]the programme of the nsdap, known colloquially as the "nazi party", was laid out in their 25-point programme on 24 february 1920. this did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the völkisch pan-germanic movement, such as ultranationalism, opposition to the treaty of versailles, distrust of capitalism, as well as some socialist ideas. for hitler, though, the most important aspect of it was its strong anti-semitic stance. he also perceived the programme as primarily a basis for propaganda and for attracting people to the party.[112]hitler and the nsdap were not, fundamentally, reactionaries – although they did look back to a mythic halcyon germany of the past – but were, instead, revolutionary. they sought "the destruction of existing political and social structure and their supporting elites [and had] profound disdain for civil order, for human and moral values" and for the ideas of classical liberalism as well as those of marxism.[113]beer hall putsch and landsberg prisonmain article: beer hall putsch defendants in the beer hall putsch trial. from left to right: pernet, weber, frick, kiebel, ludendorff, hitler, bruckner, röhm, and wagner.in 1923 hitler enlisted the help of world war i general erich ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the "beer hall putsch". the nsdap used italian fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. hitler wanted to emulate benito mussolini's "march on rome" of 1922 by staging his own coup in bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in berlin. hitler and ludendorff sought the support of staatskommissar (state commissioner) gustav ritter von kahr, bavaria's de facto ruler. however, kahr, along with police chief hans ritter von seisser and reichswehr general otto von lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without hitler.[114]on 8 november 1923 hitler and the sa stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by kahr in the bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in munich. interrupting kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with ludendorff.[115] retiring to a back room, hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of kahr, seisser, and lossow.[115] hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local reichswehr and police headquarters, but kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with hitler.[116] the next day, hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the bavarian war ministry to overthrow the bavarian government, but police dispersed them.[117] sixteen nsdap members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.[118] dust jacket of mein kampf (1926–28 edition)hitler fled to the home of ernst hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide.[119] he was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 november 1923 for high treason.[120] his trial before the special people's court in munich began in february 1924,[121] and alfred rosenberg became temporary leader of the nsdap. on 1 april, hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at landsberg prison.[122] there, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. pardoned by the bavarian supreme court, he was released from jail on 20 december 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.[123] including time on remand, hitler served just over one year in prison.[124]while at landsberg, hitler dictated most of the first volume of mein kampf (my struggle; originally entitled four and a half years of struggle against lies, stupidity, and cowardice) at first to his chauffeur, emil maurice, and then to his deputy, rudolf hess.[124][125] the book, dedicated to thule society member dietrich eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. the book laid out hitler's plans for transforming german society into one based on race. throughout the book, jews are equated with "germs" and presented as the "international poisoners" of society. according to hitler's ideology, the only solution was their extermination. while hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished, his "inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable," according to ian kershaw.[126]published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, mein kampf sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. one million copies were sold in 1933, hitler's first year in office.[127]shortly before hitler was eligible for parole, the bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to austria.[128] the austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the german army made his austrian citizenship void.[129] in response, hitler formally renounced his austrian citizenship on 7 april 1925.[129]rebuilding the nazi partyat the time of hitler's release from prison, politics in germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting hitler's opportunities for political agitation. as a result of the failed beer hall putsch, the nazi party and its affiliated organisations were banned in bavaria. in a meeting with the prime minister of bavaria heinrich held on 4 january 1925, hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. the meeting paved the way for the ban on the nsdap to be lifted on 16 february.[130] however, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 february, hitler was barred from public speaking by the bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.[131][132] to advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, hitler appointed gregor strasser, otto strasser and joseph goebbels to organise and enlarge the nsdap in northern germany. gregor strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.[133]the stock market in the united states crashed on 24 october 1929. the impact in germany was dire: millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. hitler and the nsdap prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. they promised to repudiate the versailles treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs.[134]rise to powermain article: adolf hitler's rise to powernsdap election results[135]electiontotal votes% votesreichstag seatsnotesmay

hitler's term as chancellor of germanybrüning administrationthe great depression provided a political opportunity for hitler. germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. the moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the german referendum of 1929 helped to elevate nazi ideology.[136] the elections of september 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. its leader, chancellor heinrich brüning of the centre party, governed through emergency decrees from president paul von hindenburg. governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government.[137] the nsdap rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.[138] hitler and nsdap treasurer franz xaver schwarz at the dedication of the renovation of the palais barlow on brienner straße in munich into the brown house headquarters, december 1930hitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two reichswehr officers, lieutenants richard scheringer and hans ludin, in late 1930. both were charged with membership in the nsdap, at that time illegal for reichswehr personnel.[139] the prosecution argued that the nsdap was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer hans frank to call on hitler to testify.[140] on 25 september 1930, hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections,[141] which won him many supporters in the officer corps.[142]brüning's austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular.[143] hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.[144]although hitler had terminated his austrian citizenship in 1925, he did not acquire german citizenship for almost seven years. this meant that he was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.[145] on 25 february 1932, the interior minister of brunswick, dietrich klagges, who was a member of the nsdap, appointed hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the reichsrat in berlin, making hitler a citizen of brunswick,[146] and thus of germany.[147]hitler ran against hindenburg in the 1932 presidential elections. a speech to the industry club in düsseldorf on 27 january 1932 won him support from many of germany's most powerful industrialists.[148] hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, catholic, and republican parties, and some social democrats. hitler used the campaign slogan "hitler über deutschland" ("hitler over germany"), a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft.[149] he was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for political purposes, and used it effectively.[150][151] hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election. although he lost to hindenburg, this election established hitler as a strong force in german politics.[152]appointment as chancellor hitler, at the window of the reich chancellery, receives an ovation on the evening of his inauguration as chancellor, 30 january 1933the absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, franz von papen and alfred hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to hindenburg. the signers urged hindenburg to appoint hitler as leader of a government "independent from parliamentary parties", which could turn into a movement that would "enrapture millions of people".[153][154]hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections—in july and november 1932—had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the nsdap and hugenberg's party, the german national people's party (dnvp). on 30 january 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in hindenburg's office. the nsdap gained three posts: hitler was named chancellor, wilhelm frick minister of the interior, and hermann göring minister of the interior for prussia.[155] hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of germany.[156]reichstag fire and march electionsas chancellor, hitler worked against attempts by the nsdap's opponents to build a majority government. because of the political stalemate, he asked hindenburg to again dissolve the reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early march. on 27 february 1933, the reichstag building was set on fire. göring blamed a communist plot, because dutch communist marinus van der lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.[157] according to kershaw, the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der lubbe actually set the fire.[158] others, including william l. shirer and alan bullock, are of the opinion that the nsdap itself was responsible.[159][160] at hitler's urging, hindenburg responded with the reichstag fire decree of 28 february, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. the decree was permitted under article 48 of the weimar constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.[161] activities of the german communist party (kpd) were suppressed, and some 4,000 kpd members were arrested.[162]in addition to political campaigning, the nsdap engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. on election day, 6 march 1933, the nsdap's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. hitler's party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the dnvp.[163]day of potsdam and the enabling actmain article: enabling act of 1933 hitler and paul von hindenburg on the day of potsdam, 21 march 1933on 21 march 1933, the new reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the garrison church in potsdam. this "day of potsdam" was held to demonstrate unity between the nazi movement and the old prussian elite and military. hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted hindenburg.[164][165]to achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, hitler's government brought the ermächtigungsgesetz (enabling act) to a vote in the newly elected reichstag. the act—officially titled the gesetz zur behebung der not von volk und reich ("law to remedy the distress of people and reich")—gave hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the reichstag for four years. these laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.[166] since it would affect the constitution, the enabling act required a two-thirds majority to pass. leaving nothing to chance, the nazis used the provisions of the reichstag fire decree to arrest all 81 communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the nazis had allowed the kpd to contest the election[167]) and prevent several social democrats from attending.[168]on 23 march 1933, the reichstag assembled at the kroll opera house under turbulent circumstances. ranks of sa men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.[169] the position of the centre party, the third largest party in the reichstag, was decisive. after hitler verbally promised party leader ludwig kaas that hindenburg would retain his power of veto, kaas announced the centre party would support the enabling act. the act passed by a vote of 441–84, with all parties except the social democrats voting in favour. the enabling act, along with the reichstag fire decree, transformed hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.[170]dictatorshipat the risk of appearing to talk nonsense i tell you that the national socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years! ... don't forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when i declared that one day i would govern germany. they laugh now, just as foolishly, when i declare that i shall remain in power![171]— adolf hitler to a british correspondent in berlin, june 1934having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. the social democratic party was banned and its assets seized.[172] while many trade union delegates were in berlin for may day activities, sa stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country. on 2 may 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested. some were sent to concentration camps.[173] the german labour front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of national socialism in the spirit of hitler's volksgemeinschaft ("people's community").[174] in 1934, hitler became germany's head of state with the title of führer und reichskanzler (leader and chancellor of the reich).by the end of june, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. this included the nazis' nominal coalition partner, the dnvp; with the sa's help, hitler forced its leader, hugenberg, to resign on 29 june. on 14 july 1933, the nsdap was declared the only legal political party in germany.[174][172] the demands of the sa for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. in response, hitler purged the entire sa leadership in the night of the long knives, which took place from 30 june to 2 july 1934.[175] hitler targeted ernst röhm and other sa leaders who, along with a number of hitler's political adversaries (such as gregor strasser and former chancellor kurt von schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot.[176] while the international community and some germans were shocked by the murders, many in germany believed hitler was restoring order.[177]on 2 august 1934, hindenburg died. the previous day, the cabinet had enacted the "law concerning the highest state office of the reich".[2] this law stated that upon hindenburg's death, the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as führer und reichskanzler (leader and chancellor),[1] although reichskanzler was eventually quietly dropped.[178] with this action, hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.[179]as head of state, hitler became commander-in-chief of the armed forces. immediately after hindenberg's death, at the instigation of the leadership of the reichswehr, the traditional loyalty oath of soldiers was altered to affirm loyalty to hitler personally, by name, rather than to the office of commander-in-chief (which was later renamed to supreme commander) or the state.[180] on 19 august, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.[181] hitler's personal standardin early 1938, hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the blomberg–fritsch affair. hitler forced his war minister, field marshal werner von blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that blomberg's new wife had a record for prostitution.[182][183] army commander colonel-general werner von fritsch was removed after the schutzstaffel (ss) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship.[184] both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to hitler's demand to make the wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938.[185] hitler assumed blomberg's title of commander-in-chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces. he replaced the ministry of war with the oberkommando der wehrmacht (okw), headed by general wilhelm keitel. on the same day, sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-nazi.[186] by early february 1938, twelve more generals had been removed.[187]hitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. many of his decrees were explicitly based on the reichstag fire decree and hence on article 48 of the weimar constitution. the reichstag renewed the enabling act twice, each time for a four-year period.[188] while elections to the reichstag were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of nazis and pro-nazi "guests" which carried with well over 90 percent of the vote.[189] these elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who didn't vote or dared to vote no.[190]nazi germanymain article: nazi germanyeconomy and culturemain article: economy of nazi germany ceremony honouring the dead (totenehrung) on the terrace in front of the hall of honour (ehrenhalle) at the nazi party rally grounds, nuremberg, september 1934in august 1934, hitler appointed reichsbank president hjalmar schacht as minister of economics, and in the following year, as plenipotentiary for war economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.[191] reconstruction and rearmament were financed through mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the state, including jews.[192] unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936.[193] hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in german history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the weimar republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.[194] the average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average german was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.[195]hitler's government sponsored architecture on an immense scale. albert speer, instrumental in implementing hitler's classicist reinterpretation of german culture, was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of berlin.[196] despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, germany hosted the 1936 olympic games. hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the winter games in garmisch-partenkirchen and the summer games in berlin.[197]rearmament and new alliancesmain articles: axis powers, tripartite pact, and german re-armamentin a meeting with german military leaders on 3 february 1933, hitler spoke of "conquest for lebensraum in the east and its ruthless germanisation" as his ultimate foreign policy objectives.[198] in march, prince bernhard wilhelm von bülow, secretary at the auswärtiges amt (foreign office), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: anschluss with austria, the restoration of germany's national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the treaty of versailles, the return of the former german colonies in africa, and a german zone of influence in eastern europe. hitler found bülow's goals to be too modest.[199] in speeches during this period, he stressed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements.[200] at the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.[201] benito mussolini with hitler on 25 october 1936, when the axis between italy and germany was declared.germany withdrew from the league of nations and the world disarmament conference in october 1933.[202] in january 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the saarland, then under league of nations administration, voted to unite with germany.[203] that march, hitler announced an expansion of the wehrmacht to 600,000 members—six times the number permitted by the versailles treaty—including development of an air force (luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (kriegsmarine). britain, france, italy, and the league of nations condemned these violations of the treaty, but did nothing to stop it.[204][205] the anglo-german naval agreement (agna) of 18 june allowed german tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the british navy. hitler called the signing of the agna "the happiest day of his life", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the anglo-german alliance he had predicted in mein kampf.[206] france and italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the league of nations and setting the treaty of versailles on the path towards irrelevance.[207]germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the rhineland in march 1936, in violation of the versailles treaty. hitler also sent troops to spain to support general franco during the spanish civil war after receiving an appeal for help in july 1936. at the same time, hitler continued his efforts to create an anglo-german alliance.[208] in august 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, hitler ordered göring to implement a four year plan to prepare germany for war within the next four years.[209] the plan envisaged an all-out struggle between "judeo-bolshevism" and german national socialism, which in hitler's view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.[210]count galeazzo ciano, foreign minister of mussolini's government, declared an axis between germany and italy, and on 25 november, germany signed the anti-comintern pact with japan. britain, china, italy, and poland were also invited to join the anti-comintern pact, but only italy signed in 1937. hitler abandoned his plan of an anglo-german alliance, blaming "inadequate" british leadership.[211] at a meeting in the reich chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that november, hitler restated his intention of acquiring lebensraum for the german people. he ordered preparations for war in the east, to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943. in the event of his death, the conference minutes, recorded as the hossbach memorandum, were to be regarded as his "political testament".[212] he felt that a severe decline in living standards in germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing austria and czechoslovakia.[213][214] hitler urged quick action before britain and france gained a permanent lead in the arms race.[213] in early 1938, in the wake of the blomberg–fritsch affair, hitler asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, dismissing neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as war minister.[209] from early 1938 onwards, hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war.[215]world war ii hitler and the japanese foreign minister, yōsuke matsuoka, at a meeting in berlin in march 1941. in the background is joachim von ribbentrop.early diplomatic successesalliance with japansee also: germany–japan relationsin february 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-japanese joachim von ribbentrop, hitler ended the sino-german alliance with the republic of china to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful empire of japan. hitler announced german recognition of manchukuo, the japanese-occupied state in manchuria, and renounced german claims to their former colonies in the pacific held by japan.[216] hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to china and recalled all german officers working with the chinese army.[216] in retaliation, chinese general chiang kai-shek cancelled all sino-german economic agreements, depriving the germans of many chinese raw materials.[217] october 1938: hitler is driven through the crowd in cheb (german: eger), in the mostly german-populated sudetenland region of czechoslovakia, which had been annexed to nazi germany as part of the munich agreementaustria and czechoslovakiaon 12 march 1938, hitler announced the unification of austria with nazi germany in the anschluss.[218][219] hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic german population of the sudetenland region of czechoslovakia.[220]on 28–29 march 1938, hitler held a series of secret meetings in berlin with konrad henlein of the sudeten german party, the largest of the ethnic german parties of the sudetenland. the men agreed that henlein would demand increased autonomy for sudeten germans from the czechoslovakian government, thus providing a pretext for german military action against czechoslovakia. in april 1938 henlein told the foreign minister of hungary that "whatever the czech government might offer, he would always raise still higher demands ... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up czechoslovakia quickly".[221] in private, hitler considered the sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against czechoslovakia.[222]in april hitler ordered the okw to prepare for fall grün (case green), the code name for an invasion of czechoslovakia.[223] as a result of intense french and british diplomatic pressure, on 5 september czechoslovakian president edvard beneš unveiled the "fourth plan" for constitutional reorganisation of his country, which agreed to most of henlein's demands for sudeten autonomy.[224] henlein's party responded to beneš' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain sudeten districts.[225][226]germany was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with britain over the czechoslovakian dispute could curtail germany's oil supplies. this forced hitler to call off fall grün, originally planned for 1 october 1938.[227] on 29 september hitler, neville chamberlain, édouard daladier, and mussolini attended a one-day conference in munich that led to the munich agreement, which handed over the sudetenland districts to germany.[228][229]chamberlain was satisfied with the munich conference, calling the outcome "peace for our time", while hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938;[230][231] he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 october in saarbrücken.[232] in hitler's view, the british-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible german demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting british power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of germany.[233][234] as a result of the summit, hitler was selected time magazine's man of the year for 1938.[235]in late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced hitler to make major defence cuts.[236] in his "export or die" speech of 30 january 1939, he called for an economic offensive to increase german foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.[236]on 15 march 1939, in violation of the munich accord and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets,[237] hitler ordered the wehrmacht to invade prague, and from prague castle he proclaimed bohemia and moravia a german protectorate.[238]start of world war iisee also: causes of world war iiin private discussions in 1939, hitler declared britain the main enemy to be defeated and that poland's obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal.[239] the eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to germany's lebensraum.[240] offended by the british "guarantee" on 31 march 1939 of polish independence, he said, "i shall brew them a devil's drink".[241] in a speech in wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship tirpitz on 1 april, he threatened to denounce the anglo-german naval agreement if the british continued to guarantee polish independence, which he perceived as an "encirclement" policy.[241] poland was to either become a german satellite state or it would be neutralised in order to secure the reich's eastern flank and prevent a possible british blockade.[242] hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939.[243] on 3 april, hitler ordered the military to prepare for fall weiss ("case white"), the plan for invading poland on 25 august.[243] in a reichstag speech on 28 april, he renounced both the anglo-german naval agreement and the german–polish non-aggression pact.[244] historians such as william carr, gerhard weinberg, and ian kershaw have argued that one reason for hitler's rush to war was his fear of an early death. he had repeatedly claimed that he must lead germany into war before he got too old, as his successors might lack his strength of will.[245][246][247] hitler portrayed on a 42 pfennig stamp from 1944. the term grossdeutsches reich (greater german reich) was first used in 1943 for the expanded germany under his rule.hitler was concerned that a military attack against poland could result in a premature war with britain.[242][248] hitler's foreign minister and former ambassador to london, joachim von ribbentrop, assured him that neither britain nor france would honour their commitments to poland.[249][250] accordingly, on 22 august 1939 hitler ordered a military mobilisation against poland.[251]this plan required tacit soviet support,[252] and the non-aggression pact (the molotov–ribbentrop pact) between germany and the soviet union, led by joseph stalin, included a secret agreement to partition poland between the two countries.[253] contrary to ribbentrop's prediction that britain would sever anglo-polish ties, britain and poland signed the anglo-polish alliance on 25 august 1939. this, along with news from italy that mussolini would not honour the pact of steel, prompted hitler to postpone the attack on poland from 25 august to 1 september.[254] hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the british into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 august; he then instructed ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on british and polish inaction.[255][256]on 1 september 1939, germany invaded western poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the free city of danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the polish corridor, which germany had ceded under the versailles treaty.[257] in response, britain and france declared war on germany on 3 september, surprising hitler and prompting him to angrily ask ribbentrop, "now what?"[258] france and britain did not act on their declarations immediately, and on 17 september, soviet forces invaded eastern poland.[259] hitler reviews troops on the march during the campaign against poland. september 1939the fall of poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the "phoney war" or sitzkrieg ("sitting war"). hitler instructed the two newly appointed gauleiters of north-western poland, albert forster of reichsgau danzig-west prussia and arthur greiser of reichsgau wartheland, to germanise their areas, with "no questions asked" about how this was accomplished.[260] in forster's area, ethnic poles merely had to sign forms stating that they had german blood.[261] in contrast, greiser agreed with himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards poles. greiser soon complained that forster was allowing thousands of poles to be accepted as "racial" germans and thus endangered german "racial purity".[260] hitler refrained from getting involved. this inaction has been advanced as an example of the theory of "working towards the führer", in which hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own.[260][262]another dispute pitched one side represented by heinrich himmler and greiser, who championed ethnic cleansing in poland, against another represented by göring and hans frank (governor-general of occupied poland), who called for turning poland into the "granary" of the reich.[263] on 12 february 1940, the dispute was initially settled in favour of the göring–frank view, which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions.[263] on 15 may 1940, himmler issued a memo entitled "some thoughts on the treatment of alien population in the east", calling for the expulsion of the entire jewish population of europe into africa and the reduction of the polish population to a "leaderless class of labourers".[263] hitler called himmler's memo "good and correct",[263] and, ignoring göring and frank, implemented the himmler–greiser policy in poland. hitler visits paris with architect albert speer (left) and sculptor arno breker (right), 23 june 1940on 9 april, german forces invaded denmark and norway. on the same day hitler proclaimed the birth of the greater germanic reich, his vision of a united empire of germanic nations of europe in which the dutch, flemish, and scandinavians were joined into a "racially pure" polity under german leadership.[264] in may 1940, germany attacked france, and conquered luxembourg, the netherlands, and belgium. these victories prompted mussolini to have italy join forces with hitler on 10 june. france and germany signed an armistice on 22 june.[265] kershaw notes that hitler's popularity within germany – and german support for the war – reached its peak when he returned to berlin on 6 july from his tour of paris.[266] following the unexpected swift victory, hitler promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 field marshal ceremony.[267][268] boundaries of the nazi planned greater germanic reichbritain, whose troops were forced to evacuate france by sea from dunkirk,[269] continued to fight alongside other british dominions in the battle of the atlantic. hitler made peace overtures to the new british leader, winston churchill, and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on royal air force airbases and radar stations in south-east england. on 7 september the systematic nightly bombing of london began. the german luftwaffe failed to defeat the royal air force in what became known as the battle of britain.[270] by the end of september, hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of britain (in operation sea lion) could not be achieved, and ordered the operation postponed. the nightly air raids on british cities intensified and continued for months, including london, plymouth, and coventry.[271]on 27 september 1940, the tripartite pact was signed in berlin by saburō kurusu of imperial japan, hitler, and italian foreign minister ciano,[272] and later expanded to include hungary, romania, and bulgaria, thus yielding the axis powers. hitler's attempt to integrate the soviet union into the anti-british bloc failed after inconclusive talks between hitler and molotov in berlin in november, and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the soviet union.[273]in early 1941, german forces were deployed to north africa, the balkans, and the middle east. in february, german forces arrived in libya to bolster the italian presence. in april, hitler launched the invasion of yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of greece.[274] in may, german forces were sent to support iraqi rebel forces fighting against the british and to invade crete.[275]path to defeaton 22 june 1941, contravening the hitler–stalin non-aggression pact of 1939, over 3 million axis troops attacked the soviet union.[276] this offensive (codenamed operation barbarossa) was intended to destroy the soviet union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the western powers.[277][278] the invasion conquered a huge area, including the baltic republics, belarus, and west ukraine. by early august, axis troops had advanced 500 km (310 mi) and won the battle of smolensk. hitler ordered army group centre to temporarily halt its advance to moscow and divert its panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of leningrad and kiev.[279] his generals disagreed with this change, having advanced within 400 km (250 mi) of moscow, and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership.[280][281] the pause provided the red army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves; historian russel stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the moscow offensive, which was resumed in october 1941 and ended disastrously in december.[279] during this crisis, hitler appointed himself as head of the oberkommando des heeres.[282] hitler, announcing the declaration of war against the united states to the reichstag, on 11 december 1941on 7 december 1941, japan attacked the american fleet based at pearl harbor, hawaii. four days later, hitler declared war against the united states.[283]on 18 december 1941, himmler asked hitler, "what to do with the jews of russia?", to which hitler replied, "als partisanen auszurotten" ("exterminate them as partisans").[284] israeli historian yehuda bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from hitler for the genocide carried out during the holocaust.[284]in late 1942, german forces were defeated in the second battle of el alamein,[285] thwarting hitler's plans to seize the suez canal and the middle east. overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, hitler became distrustful of his army high command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences.[286] in december 1942 and january 1943, hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the battle of stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th army. over 200,000 axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner.[287] thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the battle of kursk.[288] hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did hitler's health.[289] the destroyed map room at the wolf's lair after the 20 july plotfollowing the allied invasion of sicily in 1943, mussolini was removed from power by victor emmanuel iii after a vote of no confidence of the grand council. marshal pietro badoglio, placed in charge of the government, soon surrendered to the allies.[290] throughout 1943 and 1944, the soviet union steadily forced hitler's armies into retreat along the eastern front. on 6 june 1944, the western allied armies landed in northern france in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, operation overlord.[291] many german officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under hitler's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.[292]between 1939 and 1945, there were many plans to assassinate hitler, some of which proceeded to significant degrees.[293] the most well known, the 20 july plot of 1944, came from within germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a german defeat in the war.[294] part of operation valkyrie, the plot involved claus von stauffenberg planting a bomb in one of hitler's headquarters, the wolf's lair at rastenburg. hitler narrowly survived because staff officer heinz brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. later, hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people.[295]defeat and deathmain article: death of adolf hitlerby late 1944, both the red army and the western allies were advancing into germany. recognising the strength and determination of the red army, hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the american and british troops, which he perceived as far weaker.[296] on 16 december, he launched the ardennes offensive to incite disunity among the western allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the soviets.[297] the offensive failed after some temporary successes.[298] with much of germany in ruins in january 1945, hitler spoke on the radio: "however grave as the crisis may be at this moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will."[299] acting on his view that germany's military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation, hitler ordered the destruction of all german industrial infrastructure before it could fall into allied hands.[300] minister for armaments albert speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.[300][301] hitler's hope to negotiate peace with the united states and britain was encouraged by the death of us president franklin d. roosevelt on 12 april 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the allies.[297][302]on 20 april, his 56th birthday, hitler made his last trip from the führerbunker (führer's shelter) to the surface. in the ruined garden of the reich chancellery, he awarded iron crosses to boy soldiers of the hitler youth, who were now fighting the red army at the front near berlin.[303] by 21 april, georgy zhukov's 1st belorussian front had broken through the defences of general gotthard heinrici's army group vistula during the battle of the seelow heights and advanced to the outskirts of berlin.[304] in denial about the dire situation, hitler placed his hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped armeeabteilung steiner (army detachment steiner), commanded by waffen-ss general felix steiner. hitler ordered steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the german ninth army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.[305]hitler on 20 april 1945 in his last public appearance, in the garden of the reich chancellery, ten days before he and eva braun committed suicide.front page of the us armed forces newspaper, stars and stripes, 2 may 1945, announcing hitler's deathduring a military conference on 22 april, hitler asked about steiner's offensive. he was told that the attack had not been launched and that the soviets had entered berlin. hitler asked everyone except wilhelm keitel, alfred jodl, hans krebs, and wilhelm burgdorf to leave the room,[306] then launched into a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders, culminating in his declaration—for the first time—that "everything was lost".[307] he announced that he would stay in berlin until the end and then shoot himself.[308]by 23 april the red army had surrounded berlin,[309] and goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city.[306] that same day, göring sent a telegram from berchtesgaden, arguing that since hitler was isolated in berlin, göring should assume leadership of germany. göring set a deadline, after which he would consider hitler incapacitated.[310] hitler responded by having göring arrested, and in his last will and testament of 29 april, he removed göring from all government positions.[311][312] on 28 april hitler discovered that himmler, who had left berlin on 20 april, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the western allies.[313][314] he ordered himmler's arrest and had hermann fegelein (himmler's ss representative at hitler's hq in berlin) shot.[315]after midnight on the night of 28–29 april, hitler married eva braun in a small civil ceremony in the führerbunker.[316][d] later that afternoon, hitler was informed that mussolini had been executed by the italian resistance movement on the previous day; this presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.[317]on 30 april 1945, soviet troops were within a block or two of the reich chancellery when hitler shot himself in the head and braun bit into a cyanide capsule.[318][319] their bodies were carried outside to the garden behind the reich chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater, doused with petrol,[320] and set on fire as the red army shelling continued.[321][322] grand admiral karl dönitz and joseph goebbels assumed hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.[323]berlin surrendered on 2 may. records in the soviet archives obtained after the fall of the soviet union state that the remains of hitler, braun, joseph and magda goebbels, the six goebbels children, general hans krebs, and hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed.[324] on 4 april 1970, a soviet kgb team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the smersh facility in magdeburg. the remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the biederitz river, a tributary of the elbe.[325] according to kershaw, the corpses of braun and hitler were fully burned when the red army found them, and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as hitler's remains.[326]the holocaustmain articles: the holocaust and final solutionif the international jewish financiers in and outside europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the bolshevisation of the earth, and thus the victory of jewry, but the annihilation of the jewish race in europe![327]— adolf hitler addressing the german reichstag, 30 january 1939 a wagon piled high with corpses outside the crematorium in the liberated buchenwald concentration camp (april 1945)the holocaust and germany's war in the east were based on hitler's long-standing view that the jews were the enemy of the german people and that lebensraum was needed for germany's expansion. he focused on eastern europe for this expansion, aiming to defeat poland and the soviet union and then removing or killing the jews and slavs.[328] the generalplan ost (general plan east) called for deporting the population of occupied eastern europe and the soviet union to west siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered;[329] the conquered territories were to be colonised by german or "germanised" settlers.[330] the goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the soviet union, but when this failed, hitler moved the plans forward.[329][331] by january 1942, he had decided that the jews, slavs, and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed.[332][e] hitler's order for aktion t4, dated 1 september 1939the genocide was organised and executed by heinrich himmler and reinhard heydrich. the records of the wannsee conference, held on 20 january 1942 and led by heydrich, with fifteen senior nazi officials participating, provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the holocaust. on 22 february, hitler was recorded saying, "we shall regain our health only by eliminating the jews".[333] similarly, at a meeting in july 1941 with leading functionaries of the eastern territories, hitler said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the areas would be best achieved by "shooting everyone who even looks odd".[334] although no direct order from hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced,[335] his public speeches, orders to his generals, and the diaries of nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of european jewry.[336][337] during the war, hitler repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled, namely, that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the jewish race.[338] hitler approved the einsatzgruppen—killing squads that followed the german army through poland, the baltic, and the soviet union[339]—and was well informed about their activities.[336][340] by summer 1942, auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for killing or enslavement.[341] scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout europe, with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination.[342]between 1939 and 1945, the schutzstaffel (ss), assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million non-combatants,[343][329] including 5.5 to 6 million jews (representing two-thirds of the jewish population of europe),[344][345] and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 romani people.[346][345] deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. many victims of the holocaust were gassed to death, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers.[347] in addition to eliminating jews, the nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the hunger plan. food supplies would be diverted to the german army and german civilians. cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by german colonists.[348] together, the hunger plan and generalplan ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the soviet union.[349] these partially fulfilled plans resulted in additional deaths, bringing the total number of civilians and prisoners of war who died in the democide to an estimated 19.3 million people.[350]hitler's policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million non-jewish poles,[351] over three million soviet prisoners of war,[352] communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled,[353][354] jehovah's witnesses, adventists, and trade unionists. hitler did not speak publicly about the killings, and seems never to have visited the concentration camps.[355]the nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene. on 15 september 1935, hitler presented two laws—known as the nuremberg laws—to the reichstag. the laws banned sexual relations and marriages between aryans and jews and were later extended to include "gypsies, negroes or their bastard offspring".[356] the laws stripped all non-aryans of their german citizenship and forbade the employment of non-jewish women under the age of 45 in jewish households.[357] hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed action brandt, and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as aktion t4.[358]leadership style hitler during a meeting at the headquarters of army group south in june 1942hitler ruled the nsdap autocratically by asserting the führerprinzip (leader principle). the principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. rank in the party was not determined by elections—positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.[359] hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have "the stronger one [do] the job".[360] in this way, hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. his cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.[361][362] hitler typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated verbally, or had them conveyed through his close associate, martin bormann.[363] he entrusted bormann with his paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to hitler.[364]hitler dominated his country's war effort during world war ii to a greater extent than any other national leader. he strengthened his control of the armed forces in 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding germany's military strategy. his decision to mount a risky series of offensives against norway, france, and the low countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the united kingdom out of the war ended in failure.[365] hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the army in december 1941; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the soviet union, while his military commanders facing the western allies retained a degree of autonomy.[366] hitler's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against germany, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory.[365] in the final months of the war hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the complete destruction of germany as preferable to surrender.[367] the military did not challenge hitler's dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.[368]legacyfurther information: consequences of nazism and neo-nazism outside the building in braunau am inn, austria, where hitler was born, is a memorial stone placed as a reminder of the horrors of world war ii. the inscription translates as: for peace, freedomand democracynever again fascismmillions of dead remind [us]hitler's suicide was likened by contemporaries to a "spell" being broken.[369][370] public support for hitler had collapsed by the time of his death and few germans mourned his passing; kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest.[371] according to historian john toland, national socialism "burst like a bubble" without its leader.[372]hitler's actions and nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral;[373] according to kershaw, "never in history has such ruination—physical and moral—been associated with the name of one man".[374] hitler's political programme brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished eastern and central europe. germany itself suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as stunde null (zero hour).[375] hitler's policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale;[376] according to r. j. rummel, the nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war.[343] in addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the european theatre of world war ii.[343] the number of civilians killed during the second world war was unprecedented in the history of warfare.[377] historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word "evil" to describe the nazi regime.[378] many european countries have criminalised both the promotion of nazism and holocaust denial.[379]historian friedrich meinecke described hitler as "one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life".[380] english historian hugh trevor-roper saw him as "among the 'terrible simplifiers' of history, the most systematic, the most historical, the most philosophical, and yet the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known".[381] for the historian john m. roberts, hitler's defeat marked the end of a phase of european history dominated by germany.[382] in its place emerged the cold war, a global confrontation between the western bloc, dominated by the united states and other nato nations, and the eastern bloc, dominated by the soviet union.[383] historian sebastian haffner asserts that without hitler and the displacement of the jews, the modern nation state of israel would not exist. he contends that without hitler, the de-colonisation of former european spheres of influence would have been postponed.[384] further, haffner claims that other than alexander the great, hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.[385]views on religionmain article: religious views of adolf hitlerhitler was born to a practising catholic mother and an anticlerical father; after leaving home hitler never again attended mass or received the sacraments.[386][387][388] speer states that hitler railed against the church to his political associates and though he never officially left it, he had no attachment to it.[389] he adds that hitler felt that in the absence of organised religion, people would turn to mysticism, which he considered regressive.[389] according to speer, hitler believed that japanese religious beliefs or islam would have been a more suitable religion for germans than christianity, with its "meekness and flabbiness".[390]historian john s. conway states that hitler was fundamentally opposed to the christian churches.[391] according to bullock, hitler did not believe in god, was anticlerical, and held christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of "survival of the fittest".[392] he favoured aspects of protestantism that suited his own views, and adopted some elements of the catholic church's hierarchical organisation, liturgy, and phraseology.[393]hitler viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society,[394] and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that "suited his immediate political purposes".[391] in public, hitler often praised christian heritage and german christian culture, though professing a belief in an "aryan jesus" who fought against the jews.[395] any pro-christian public rhetoric contradicted his private statements, which described christianity as "absurdity"[396] and nonsense founded on lies.[397]according to a us office of strategic services (oss) report, "the nazi master plan", hitler planned to destroy the influence of christian churches within the reich.[398][399] his eventual goal was the total elimination of christianity.[400] this goal informed hitler's movement early on, but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position.[401] according to bullock, hitler wanted to wait until after the war before executing this plan.[402]speer wrote that hitler had a negative view of himmler's and alfred rosenberg's mystical notions and himmler's attempt to mythologise the ss. hitler was more pragmatic, and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns.[403][404]healthsee also: adolf hitler's health and psychopathography of adolf hitlerresearchers have variously suggested that hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis,[405] parkinson's disease,[289][406] syphilis,[406] giant-cell arteritis,[407] and tinnitus.[408] in a report prepared for the oss in 1943, walter c. langer of harvard university described hitler as a "neurotic psychopath".[409] in his 1977 book the psychopathic god: adolf hitler, historian robert g. l. waite proposes that he suffered from borderline personality disorder.[410] historians henrik eberle and hans-joachim neumann consider that while he suffered from a number of illnesses including parkinson's disease, hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, his decisions.[411][307] theories about hitler's medical condition are difficult to prove, and placing too much weight on them may have the effect of attributing many of the events and consequences of nazi germany to the possibly impaired physical health of one individual.[412] kershaw feels that it is better to take a broader view of german history by examining what social forces led to the nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for the holocaust and world war ii based on only one person.[413]hitler followed a vegetarian diet.[414] at social events he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his guests shun meat.[415] bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the berghof (near berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for hitler.[416] hitler publicly avoided alcohol. he occasionally drank beer and wine in private, but gave up drinking because of weight gain in 1943.[417] he was a non-smoker for most of his adult life, but smoked heavily in his youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); he eventually quit, calling the habit "a waste of money".[418] he encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit.[419] hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942.[420] speer linked this use of amphetamine to hitler's increasingly erratic behaviour and inflexible decision making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).[421]prescribed 90 medications during the war years by his personal physician, theodor morell, hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments.[422] he regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine,[423][424] as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of doktor koster's antigaspills).[425] he suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of the 20 july plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs.[426] newsreel footage of hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life.[422] ernst-günther schenck and several other doctors who met hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of parkinson's disease.[427]familymain articles: hitler family and sexuality of adolf hitler hitler in 1942 with his long-time lover, eva braun, whom he married on 29 april 1945, the day before they both committed suicide.hitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation.[145][428] he met his lover, eva braun, in 1929,[429] and married her on 29 april 1945.[430] in september 1931, his half-niece, geli raubal, took her own life with hitler's gun in his munich apartment. it was rumoured among contemporaries that geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death was a source of deep, lasting pain.[431] paula hitler, the younger sister of hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in june 1960.[14]in propagandafilmssee also: adolf hitler in popular culture and list of speeches given by adolf

films throughout his political career—such as der sieg des glaubens and triumph des willens—made by leni riefenstahl, regarded as a pioneer of modern filmmaking.[432]list of propaganda and film

the death of paul von hindenburg, who had been serving as president. he was afterwards both head of state and head of the government, with the full official title of führer und reichskanzler des deutschen volkes ("führer and reich chancellor of the german people").[1][2]^  the successor institution to the realschule in linz is bundesrealgymnasium linz fadingerstraße.^  hitler also won settlement from a libel suit against the socialist paper the münchener post, which had questioned his lifestyle and income. kershaw 2008, p. 99.^  mi5, hitler's last days: "hitler's will and marriage"

article (ga) is an article that meets a core set of editorial standards but is not featured article quality. good articles meet the good article criteria, passing through the good article nomination process successfully. they are well written, contain factually accurate and verifiable information, are broad in coverage, neutral in point of view, stable, and illustrated, where possible, by relevant images with suitable copyright licenses. good articles do not have to be as comprehensive as featured articles, but they should not omit any major facets of the topic: a comparison of the criteria for good and featured articles describes further differences.currently, out of the 5,809,020 articles on wikipedia, 29,229 are categorized as good articles (about 1 in 199), most of which are listed below. an additional 5,464 are listed as featured articles (about 1 in 1,070) and 3,439 as featured lists (about 1 in 1,690). because articles are only included on one list, a good article that has been promoted to featured status is removed from the good articles list. adding good and featured articles and lists together gives a total of 38,132 articles (about 1 in 153). a small plus sign inside a circle () in the top-right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is good.the process for designating an article as a good article is intentionally straightforward. any editor, preferably one who creates or contributes to an article, who believes that the article meets the good article criteria, may nominate the article for an impartial reviewer to assess. another editor may review the article after selecting it from a queue of good article nominations then evaluating it against the good article criteria. if it is accepted by the reviewer, the nominated article is added to the list of good articles below. anyone may nominate or review an article by following the instructions. similarly, anyone who believes that an article no longer meets the good article criteria may propose to delist it by following the instructions for reassessment.more good content is available at wikipedia:good topics..mw-parser-output

chinese army's successful engagement during the wuhan theatre of the second sino-japanese war against the japanese 101st, 106th, 9th and 27th divisions around the wanjialing region in 1938. the two and a half month battle resulted in heavy losses of the japanese 101st and 106th divisions.contents1 combatants1.1 chinese1.2 japanese2 battle3 aftermath4 references5 sourcescombatants[edit]chinese[edit]in the battle of wanjialing, the chinese side consisted of the 4th army, the elite 74th army, 66th army, 187th division, 91st division, new 13th division, 142nd division, 60th division, reserved 6th division, 19th division, a brigade from the 139th division and the new 15th division, which totals up to 100,000 men. the chief commander in the frontline was the commander of the 9th group army wu qiwei. they were under the overall command of the supreme commander of the 9th military region xue yue.japanese[edit]the japanese side consisted of the 106th division, led by lieutenant-general junrokurō matsuura. under the 106th division, there were the 111th infantry brigade (113th and 147th infantry regiments) and 136th brigade (123rd and 145th infantry regiments), as well as regiments of cavalry, artillery, engineers and transport. during the battle, the 101st division was also deployed. later during the battle, the (9th and 27th divisions) would also be deployed.battle[edit] chinese troops charging during the battle.under the orders of yasuji okamura, the japanese 106th division intended to cross the wanjialing 萬家嶺 region in hopes to cut through to the rear of de'an 德安 as direct approach from jiujiang 九江 along the railway line south and approach by 101st division by pushing through from the eastern foothills of mount lu was getting nowhere. the plan was discovered by xue yue, and the chinese army managed to surround the 106th division with 16 divisions at lushan. after capturing jiujiang, 106th division tried to push south using the jiujiang to nanchang railway as the axis and capture de'an. it got a mauling at shahe 沙河 just south of jiujiang. on august 21, the japanese 101st division's sato detachment (major general sato shozaburo 佐藤正三郎, 101 brigade) consisting of two infantry battalion supported by a battalion of artillery captured xingzi as part of the push to de'an, but faced fierce resistance from wang jingjiu's 25th corps and ye zhao's 66th corps. reinforced with saeda's detachment (major general saeda yoshishige 佐村義重, 101st division) both forces was still unable to break through the chinese lines, japanese deployed poison gas. although the chinese had a severe shortage of protective equipment against chemical weapons, they were still able to repel the japanese attack.at the beginning of september, okamura ordered the 9th and 27th divisions to relieve the 106th division, but they were halted by fierce chinese resistance. on september 24, the japanese army finally managed to punch through the chinese lines in the west, but were then confronted by ou zhen's 4th corps and yu jishi's elite 74th corps and were once again surrounded. desperate to break open a safe path for their trapped ground forces, the japanese air force began heavy bombing on chinese positions with incendiary bombs, resulting in many chinese deaths.on october 7, the chinese suddenly launched fierce counter-attacks and the remaining japanese units that were still intact hastily retreated.  combat ended on october 10, which was coincidentally the chinese national celebration day. on october 13, the chinese forces withdrew from the battlefield.aftermath[edit]the two and a half month battle caused tremendous casualties for the japanese army, the failed offensive resulting in the crippling of the japanese 101st and 106th divisions. these two divisions initially had a combined strength of over 47,000 troops, and lost about 30,000 men in battle. in particular, the japanese officer corps took a particularly heavy hit, the high casualty rate forcing general shunroku hata to frequently airdrop replacement officers onto the bases of his besieged units throughout the battle.for the chinese, the successful defense of wanjialing played a key role in the overall wuhan campaign, halting the japanese offensive drive towards wuhan along the southern bank of the yangtze river, and buying invaluable time for the chinese government to evacuate its civilian population, war facilities, and industrial assets away from the city and westward towards cities such as the new wartime capital of chongqing.references[edit]sources[edit]archives reveal china's key victory against japanese aggressorsbattle of wuhan(in chinese) battle of wuhan: smash the japanese ambition!(in chinese)

reciprocatingthe ordnance qf 25-pounder, or more simply 25-pounder or 25-pdr, was the major british field gun and howitzer during the second world war, possessing a 3.45-inch (87.6 mm) calibre. it was introduced into service just before the war started, combining high-angle and direct-fire, relatively high rates of fire, and a reasonably lethal shell in a highly mobile piece. it remained the british army's primary artillery field piece well into the 1960s, with smaller numbers serving in training units until the 1980s. many commonwealth of nations countries used theirs in active or reserve service until about the 1970s and ammunition for the weapon is currently being produced by pakistan ordnance factories.contents1 design2 ammunition3 british service4 service with other

looking to replace the 18-pounder (3.3 inches (84 mm) bore) field gun and the 4.5-inch howitzer (114.3 mm bore), which had been the main field artillery equipments during the first world war. the basic idea was to build one weapon with the high velocity of the 18-pounder and the variable propelling charges of the howitzer, firing a shell about halfway between the two in size, around 3.5–4.0 inches (89–102 mm) of about 30 pounds (14 kg).development during the inter-war period was severely hampered by a lack of money and it was eventually decided to build a "new" design from existing 18-pounders by converting barrels but designing a new barrel and carriage for production when funds were available. the result was a 3.45 inches (87.6 mm) weapon firing a shell weighing 25 pounds (11.3 kg). it was mounted on late model 18-pounder carriages. one of these used a circular firing platform and this was adopted for the new guns. the firing platform was attached to the gun and when lowered the gun was pulled onto it. this platform transferred most of the recoil forces to the ground, instead of using the spade at the end of the trail, making the gun very stable when firing. it also provided a smooth flat surface for the carriage to rotate on using the road wheels, this enabled the gunners to traverse the carriage quickly in any direction. a 25-pounder field gun and limber, towed by a morris commercial "quad", crossing a pontoon bridge at slaght bridge in antrim, northern ireland, 26 june 1942 a 25 pounder with its wheels elevated on ammunition boxes for an extremely high angle of fire, san clemente, italy 2 december 1944unlike the 18-pounder, the 25-pounder used howitzer-type variable-charge ammunition. the 25-pounder was separate-loading; the shell was loaded and rammed, then the cartridge in its brass case was loaded and the breech closed. in british terminology, the 25-pounder was called "quick firing" (qf), originally because the cartridge case provided rapid loading compared with bag charges, and was automatically released when the breech was opened.the use of separate shell and cartridge allowed the charge to be changed for different ranges. for the mk 1 ordnance on an 18-pounder carriage there were three "charges", charges one, two and three, all of which could be used in the common cartridge design. the mk 2 ordnance on mk 1 carriage added a "super" charge in a different cartridge. in 1943 a separately bagged "increment" charge was added; used with the super it provided higher velocity for anti-tank use. the introduction of the increment to super was only possible following the addition of the muzzle-brake in the previous year. subsequently, another type of increment was introduced to be added to charges one and two to provide additional combinations for use in high angle fire. however, this fire required a dial sight adaptor, removal of the platform and some excavation of the ground.in common with all british guns of the period the indirect fire sight was "calibrating". this meant that the range, not elevation angle, was set on the sight. the sight compensated for the difference in the gun's muzzle velocities from standard. the gun was also fitted with a direct-fire telescope for use with armour-piercing shot. it also used "one-man laying" in accordance with normal british practice.an important part of the gun was the ammunition trailer ("trailer, artillery, no 27"). the gun was hooked to it and the trailer hooked to the tractor for towing. the gun did not need a limber[2] and could be hooked directly to a tractor. the trailer provided the brakes as only a hand-brake was fitted to the gun carriage. the trailer carried ammunition; thirty-two rounds in trays (two rounds per tray) in the trailer protected by two doors. ammunition was also carried in the gun tractor with the detachment and various gun stores. some stores, such as sights, were carried cased on the gun. each section (two guns) had a third tractor that carried ammunition and towed two ammunition trailers.the gun detachment comprised the following:no 1 – detachment commander (a sergeant)no 2 – operated the breech and rammed the shellno 3 – layerno 4 – loaderno 5 – ammunitionno 6 – ammunition, normally the 'coverer' – second in command and responsible for ammunition preparation and operating the fuze indicatorthe official 'reduced detachment' was four men.many different companies manufactured the guns and component parts in the uk. vickers armstrong in scotswood, baker perkins in peterborough and weirs in glasgow were some of the most significant. the various royal ordnance factories produced most of the ordnance components. in canada, sorel industries built complete guns and provided the ordnance for fitting to the sexton. australia also built complete guns, choosing to weld the carriages rather than rivet, as was the practice in the uk and canada. in all, over 13,000 were made worldwide.ammunition[edit] "normal" cartridge arrangementsthe 25-pounder fired "separate"or two-part ammunition — the projectile was loaded separately from the propelling charge in its (usually brass) cartridge case with its integral primer. typically for a quick-firing gun, the cartridge case provided obturation.there were two types of cartridge. the "normal" cartridge contained three cloth charge bags (coloured red, white and blue). white or blue bags would be removed from the cartridge to give "charge one" or "charge two", leaving all three bags in the cartridge case gave "charge three". the cartridge case was closed at the top with a leatherboard cup. the second type of cartridge was "super", which provided one charge only. the cup could not be removed from the cartridge case. in 1943, an incremental charge of 5.5 oz (160 g) of cordite ("super-plus") was introduced to raise the muzzle velocity when firing armour-piercing shot with charge super; this required a muzzle brake to be fitted.[3] adoption of "upper-register" (high-angle) fire needed more charges to improve the range overlap. this led to the development of the "intermediate increment" of 4oz cordite, which was introduced in 1944. the bags were striped red and white to indicate that they should only be used with charges one and two. when one bag was used with charge 1 it provided charge 1/2. when one was added to charge 2 it provided charge 2 1/3, and two bags, charge 2 2/3. this allowed a range of seven different charges instead of four.[4] display of 25-pounder shells and cases. left to right: smoke, armour-piercing

separate items. royal artillery gunners fill 25 pounder shells with propaganda leaflets. roermond, the netherlands, january 1945.there were many marks of cartridge, mostly differentiated by propellant type. double-base propellant (nitrocellulose/nitroglycerine) was the uk standard but one mark used us single-base (nitrocellulose only). however, triple-base nitrocellulose/nitroglycerine/picrite was used throughout the war and eventually replaced all others.[5]the 25-pounder's main ammunition was the high-explosive (he) streamlined shell with a 5/10 crh ogive and boat tail. it was also provided with base ejection smoke (white and coloured), star shells, and chemical shells. incendiary and coloured flare shells were developed but not introduced into service, and smoke shells were sometimes reloaded with propaganda leaflets or metal foil "window". the uk did not develop a wp smoke shell for the 25-pounder.for anti-tank use, the 25-pounder was also supplied with a limited amount of 20 pounds (9.1 kg) solid armour-piercing (ap) shot, later replaced with a more potent version with a ballistic cap (apbc). the ap shot was fired with maximum charge, charge no. 3, super, or super with super increment depending on the ordnance mark, as muzzle velocity was critical in direct fire for penetration and a flat trajectory.a shaped charge anti-tank shell was under development in canada, but the introduction of the three-inch (76.2 mm) calibre qf 17 pounder, an anti-tank gun, in 1944 ended its development. after the second world war, the uk replaced ap shot with a hesh shell. coloured marker shells (dye and petn) were also developed but not introduced.the standard fuze was no 117 direct action (da). no 119 (da and graze) was also used. combustion or mechanical time fuzes were used with base ejection shells and mechanical time with graze were used with he. proximity fuzes were used from the end of 1944 and subsequently replaced by cvt fuzes.british service[edit] an australian 25-pounder at el alamein in july 1942the 25-pounder was the main field artillery weapon used by british commonwealth and colonial infantry and armoured divisions of all types during the second world war. it was also used by the raf regiment in north africa.[6] throughout the war, each british-pattern infantry division was established with 72 25-pounders, in three field artillery regiments. armoured divisions were eventually standardised with two field artillery regiments, one of which was self-propelled (see below). before mid-1940, each regiment had two batteries of twelve guns; after that date, regiments changed to batteries of eight guns and added a third battery, a process that was not completed until early 1943. in the late 1950s, the british army reverted to batteries of six guns. field artillery regiments had two batteries of 25-pounders and one of 5.5 inch guns.the early 18- and 25-pounders had been towed in the field by the morris cdsw or the dragon, a tracked vehicle derived from a light tank. throughout most of the second world war, the 25-pounder was normally towed, with its limber, behind a 4×4 field artillery tractor called a "quad". these were manufactured by morris, guy and karrier in england, and, in greater numbers, as the canadian military pattern field artillery tractor by ford and chevrolet in canada. in the 1950s, the british army replaced the various "quads" with a new bedford three-ton gun tower fitted with a specialist body. gunner's view; 25-pounder on display at edinburgh castlein 1941, the british army improvised a self-propelled 25-pounder named the bishop, on the chassis of the valentine tank. this mount proved unsatisfactory and the bishops were replaced in 1942 by the american m7 priest, which did not use the 25-pounder and complicated the supply of ammunition in the field. the priests were replaced in 1944 by the sexton, which used the 25-pounder. the sexton was designed, and mostly manufactured, in canada (some two thirds of the ordnance and mountings were imported from the uk due to limited canadian production capacity) and was the result of mounting a 25-pounder on a ram or grizzly tank chassis. a 25-pounder of the ceremonial gun troop of the royal bermuda regimentby second world war standards, the 25-pounder had a smaller calibre and lower shell-weight than many other field-artillery weapons, although it had longer range than most. (most forces had entered the war with even smaller 75 mm (3.0 in) designs but had quickly moved to 105 mm (4.1 in) and larger weapons.) it was designed for the british practice of suppressive (neutralising) fire, not destructive fire that had proved illusory in the early years of the first world war. nevertheless, the 25-pounder was considered by all to be one of the best artillery pieces in use. the effects caused by the gun (and the speed at which the british artillery control system could respond) in the north-west europe campaign of 1944–1945 made many german soldiers believe that the british had secretly deployed an automatic 25-pounder.[7]in uk service, during the 1960s, most 25-pounders were replaced by the 105mm abbot spg, some by the oto melara 105mm pack howitzer, and the remainder by the 105mm l118 light gun. the last british military unit to fire the 25-pounder in its field role (as opposed to ceremonial use) was the gun troop of the honourable artillery company on salisbury plain in 1992.[citation needed]service with other nations[edit]play media a 25-pounder firing a blank at royal armouries museum, fort nelsonin addition to commonwealth and colonial forces, other second world war users included the free forces of france, greece, poland, czechoslovakia, netherlands, belgium and luxembourg. the first shot fired by us artillery against the german army in the war was from a 25-pounder of the 34th infantry division.[8]after the second world war, 25-pounders remained in service with many commonwealth armies into the 1960s. they were used in korea by british,[9] canadian[10] and new zealand regiments[11] and in malaya by british and australian batteries. they also featured in wars on the indian sub-continent and in the service of israeli and other middle eastern armies.australia[edit]australia was an extensive user of the 25 pounder, with them seeing service with their military in ww2, korea and the malayan emergency. they were kept in use by reserve units up until 1970s. individual guns are now often seen as fixed memorials in memorial parks and returned servicemen's clubs. because of the rough terrain involved in the new guinea campaign, the heavy nature of the weapon made it difficult to use. the gun was manufactured in australia, which also made it available for use in australian developed vehicles, including a light tank, the chassis 160, the thunderbolt tank, and the self-propelled gun, the yeramba. this led to australian development of a short barreled lighter version, which was lighter and more suitable for off-road deployment.[12]south africa[edit]the gun was called g1 by the south african defence force. it was extensively used in the early stages of the south african border war, including operation savannah.[citation needed] the g1 is still used in the ceremonial role.[13]rhodesia[edit]the rhodesian army used the weapon during the bush war but by this stage the round could not penetrate enemy bunkers.[14]sri lanka[edit]the 25-pounder was extensively used by the sri lankan army during the early years of the sri lankan civil war. they were supplied by pakistan.[15] it still remains in service, although only in a ceremonial role.[citation needed]ireland[edit]in 1949, 48 ex-british-army mark iii 25-pounders were acquired by the irish defence forces and were in service with the reserves until 2009, having been replaced in the army by the 105 mm light gun in 1981. the irish army maintains a six-gun ceremonial 25-pounder battery for use on state occasions.[16]india[edit]the indian army employed the 25-pounder into the late 1970s. they used them against pakistan during the indo-pakistani war of 1947, the indo-pakistani war of 1965 and the indo-pakistani war of 1971 and against china during the sino-indian war in 1962.[17]jordan[edit]the jordanian arab legion deployed eight 25-pounder field guns during the fighting in 1948.[18] later, the royal jordanian army deployed several batteries of 25-pounders during the six-day war.[19] transjordanian arab legion gunners firing a 25 pounder field gun during the fighting around jerusalem, 1948lebanon[edit]the lebanese army aligned twenty-one qf mk iii 25-pounders on its inventory in 1975, with most of them being subsequently seized by the tigers militia and the kataeb regulatory forces (krf) militia in february 1976 and passed on to its successor, the lebanese forces in 1980.[20]luxembourg[edit] four luxembourg 25 pounder guns re-barrelled to 105 mm and fitted with new sights for gun salutesthe luxembourg army maintains a number of 25-pounder guns rebarrelled to 105 millimetres (4.1 in) and fitted with new sights for gun salutes.[21]greece[edit]the 25-pounder first entered service with greek forces in north africa during wwii. three (i, ii and iii) field artillery regiments of 24 pieces were created as part of the greek infantry brigades created. they saw significant action at el alamein and rimini. after the war, the 25-pounder served as part of the greek army during the greek civil war. a total of 125 25-pounder guns were used by the greek artillery during the civil war of 1946–1949, in various organizational schemes. after the civil war, they were organized into seven independent regiments of 18 guns. following greece's entry into nato in 1952 and the standardization on american calibres in 1953, the 25-pounders were not retired (unlike other models), but were reorganised as 13 battalions of eight guns in divisional artilleries. in 1957, the influx of american artillery pieces permitted an increase from 8 to 12 guns per battalion. in 1964, 54 25-pdr guns were delivered from greece to cyprus, where they entered service with the cyprus national guard organized into four battalions of 12 guns (181, 182, 183 and 185) and one independent battery of six guns (184). they saw action during the turkish invasion of the island in 1974. the 25-pounder remained in greek army service until 1992, when it were retired as part of the cfe agreement. the guns of the cyprus national guard remain in storage.[citation needed]new zealand[edit] 25-pounder gun of the new zealand field battery in koreathe 16th field regiment of the royal new zealand artillery, equipped with 25-pounders, was formed to join the united nations force in the korean war. the 25-pdr was replaced in first-line units by the l5 gun. the guns were withdrawn from operational service with territorial force artillery by 1977. today, 25-pounders remain in service as ceremonial gun.[11]nigeria[edit]the nigerian federal army used 25-pdr guns during the biafran war.[22] the nigerian army still fielded them in 2002.[17]iraqi kurdistan[edit]a 2015 news report shows at least one 25-pounder in service with kurdish peshmerga forces, employed against isis positions in mosul, iraq.[23]variants[edit]mark i[edit] 25-pounder field gun of 153rd field regiment (leicestershire yeomanry) during a practice shoot in the mountains near tripoli in the lebanon, 7 june 1943known officially as the "ordnance, quick firing 25-pounder mark i on carriage 18-pr mark iv", or "ordnance, quick firing 25-pounder mark i on carriage 18-pr mark v" and commonly called the "18/25-pounder". the mark i was a 25-pounder barrel and breech in the modified jacket of an 18 pounder gun, as a 'loose liner'. the jacket provided the interface to the 18-pounder carriage. the earliest versions retained 18-pounder type elevation sights but later ones had probert pattern calibrating sights on the right side of the saddle. the mark iv p, carriage was a box trail, mark v p, was a split trail. these conversions of the 18-pounder first entered british service in 1937. a few were lost in the norwegian campaign and 704 in france, leaving about the same number in uk's global stocks. they served in north africa (until about late 1941) and india. this mark of 25-pounder was limited to charge 3 due to its 18-pounder carriage.mark ii[edit] 25-pounder with a muzzle brakethe mark ii, fitted to the mark i carriage was the standard gun during the war. they were built in australia and canada but mostly in uk. deliveries (from uk production) started at the beginning of 1940 and first entered service with a canadian regiment stationed in uk during may 1940. no ordnance 25-pr mk 2 on carriage 25-pr mark 1 were lost in france. this gun fired all charges, 1 – 3 and super.in 1942, a muzzle brake was fitted to the gun to eliminate the instability caused when firing the 20 lb ap shell with charge super at direct fire low elevation angles. to preserve the gun's balance on the trunnions, a counterbalance weight was also fitted, just in front of the breech ring. the designation of the modified gun was not changed. eventually, all guns serving in europe were so converted.the mark ii ordnance had six main marks of the barrel:[24]mark i barrel[edit]original variant with a loose liner.[24]mark ii barrel[edit] a 25 pounder mk-ii at a war museum in indiathe standard design, also made in canada as c mk ii barrel.[24]mark ii/i[edit]in 1946, a programme was introduced to modify the gun's breech ring by morticing the rear corners. a corresponding modification was made to the rear corners of the breech block. this was to reduce the instances of cracking the ring.mark iii barrel[edit]the mark iii barrel was a mark ii with a modified receiver to prevent the rounds from slipping back out when loading at high angles.[24] it was introduced in january 1944.mark iii/i[edit]this was a mk iii gun with the same modification to the ring and block as for the mk ii/i.mark iv barrel[edit]the mark iv was identical to the mark iii/i, and featured the modified ring and a paired block from new.mark vi barrel[edit]the final alteration of the breech ring made in 1964.[24]short, mark i[edit]main article: ordnance qf 25-pounder short a short 25-pounder in new guinea in 1944the 25-pounder short mark i, or baby 25-pr, was an australian pack gun version of the 25-pounder, first produced in 1943. this was a shortened version of the standard 25-pounder, mounted on the carriage 25-pr light, mark 1. weighing 1,315 kilograms (2,899 lb), it was around 315 kg (694 lb) lighter than the 25-pounder mark ii.the "baby" was intended for jungle warfare and was only used by australian units in the south west pacific theatre. the gun could be towed by a jeep or broken down into 13 sections and transported by air. during the new guinea campaign the gun was manhandled up steep jungle tracks where trucks could not operate.carriages[edit]mark i[edit]the mark i carriage was the first real 25-pounder carriage. later in the war, some guns had a double spacer-separated shield to improve protection. it had probert-pattern calibrating sights, but with the range indicator wrapped into the distinctive cone that rotated against a fixed reader arm.jury axle[edit]in burma, artificers of 129 (lowland) jungle field regiment developed a local modification to use a jeep axle and wheels to produce a 20-inch narrower wheelbase for easier movement along restricted jungle paths, along with some minor modifications to the gun trail; it was called the jury axle. tests in action showed the gun was stable, it was first reported to ghq india in october 1943. it appears that it was also used without its shield, and the gun could be disassembled for transport in pieces by jeep. 139th (4th london) jungle field regiment used the modified guns and developed procedures for dismantling them for stowage aboard douglas c-47 dakota transport aircraft.[25][26]mark ii[edit]the mark ii carriage was basically the war office-approved formalisation of the jury axle version of the 25-pounder. changes included a narrower shield, a new narrower track platform (no 22), and modified jeep wheels.mark iii[edit]the mark iii carriage, also narrow, was a further development of the mark ii carriage to provide joints that enabled the trail to be cranked for "upper register" (high-angle) fire to avoid the need to dig a trail pit, and used with the cranked "dial sight adaptor" previously adopted for high-angle fire. it entered service soon after the war. high-angle fire had been introduced in italy and used increments to charges 2 and 3 to give the 25-pounder seven charges.mark iv[edit]the british did further work on the australian-designed short 25-pounder, enabling it to fire charge super. one or two prototypes were produced and the carriage was officially designated the mark iv, but never went into production.self-propelled 25-pounders[edit]bishop[edit]the bishop was a british self-propelled 25-pounder using the valentine tank chassis, soon replaced by better designs.sexton[edit]the sexton was a canadian self-propelled 25-pounder using the ram or grizzly tank chassis.yeramba[edit]the yeramba was an australian self-propelled 25-pounder using the m3 lee tank chassis.users[edit] australia belgium: used by belgian field battery during wwii[27]; also in belgian congo post-wwii[28] canada (also used in military funerals) cyprus czechoslovakia: used during

groupcamouflagebabini groupcombeforce3rd indian motor brigadebaggush boxthe first battle of el alamein (1–27 july 1942) was a battle of the western desert campaign of the second world war, fought in egypt between axis forces (germany and italy) of the panzer army africa (panzerarmee afrika, which included the afrika korps under field marshal (generalfeldmarschall) erwin rommel) and allied (british imperial and commonwealth) forces (britain, british india, australia, south africa and new zealand) of the eighth army (general claude auchinleck).the british prevented a second advance by the axis forces into egypt. axis positions near el alamein, only 66 mi (106 km) from alexandria, were dangerously close to the ports and cities of egypt, the base facilities of the commonwealth forces and the suez canal. however, the axis forces were too far from their base at tripoli in libya to remain at el alamein indefinitely, which led both sides to accumulate supplies for more offensives, against the constraints of time and distance.contents1 background1.1 retreat from gazala1.2 battle of mersa matruh2 prelude2.1 defences at el alamein2.2 axis plan of attack3 battle3.1 panzer army

front.following their defeat at the battle of gazala in eastern libya in june 1942, the british eighth army, commanded by lieutenant-general neil ritchie, had retreated east from the gazala line into north-western egypt as far as mersa matruh, roughly 100 mi (160 km) inside the border. ritchie had decided not to hold the defences on the egyptian border, because the defensive plan there was for infantry to hold defended localities and a strong armoured force behind them to meet any attempts to penetrate or outflank the fixed defences. since general ritchie had virtually no armoured units left fit to fight, the infantry positions would be defeated in detail. the mersa defence plan also included an armoured reserve but in its absence ritchie believed he could organise his infantry to cover the minefields between the defended localities to prevent axis engineers from having undisturbed access.[6]to defend the matruh line, ritchie placed 10th indian infantry division (in matruh itself) and 50th (northumbrian) infantry division (some 15 mi (24 km) down the coast at gerawla) under x corps hq, newly arrived from syria.[7] inland from x corps would be xiii corps with 5th indian infantry division (with only one infantry brigade, 29th indian, and two artillery regiments) around sidi hamza about 20 mi (32 km) inland, and the newly arrived 2nd new zealand division (short one brigade, the 6th, which had been left out of combat in case the division was captured and it would be needed to serve as the nucleus of a new division) at minqar qaim (on the escarpment 30 mi (48 km) inland) and 1st armoured division in the open desert to the south.[8] the 1st armoured division had taken over 4th and 22nd armoured brigades from 7th armoured division which by this time had only three tank regiments (battalions) between them.[9] area of western desert campaign 1941–1942 (click to enlarge).on 25 june, general claude auchinleck—commander-in-chief (c-in-c) middle east command—relieved ritchie and assumed direct command of the eighth army himself.[10] he decided not to seek a decisive confrontation at the mersa matruh position. he concluded that his inferiority in armour after the gazala defeat, meant he would be unable to prevent rommel either breaking through his centre or enveloping his open left flank to the south in the same way he had at gazala.[c] he decided instead to employ delaying tactics while withdrawing a further 100 mi (160 km) or more east to a more defensible position near el alamein on the mediterranean coast. only 40 mi (64 km) to the south of el alamein, the steep slopes of the qattara depression ruled out the possibility of axis armour moving around the southern flank of his defences and limited the width of the front he had to defend.battle of mersa matruh[edit]main article: battle of mersa matruh italian anti-aircraft battery at marsa matrouh in june of 1942while preparing the alamein positions, auchinleck fought strong delaying actions, first at mersa matruh on 26–27 june and then fuka on 28 june. the late change of orders resulted in some confusion in the forward formations (x corps and xiii corps) between the desire to inflict damage on the enemy and the intention not to get trapped in the matruh position but retreat in good order. the result was poor co-ordination between the two forward corps and units within them. late on 26 june, the 90th light and 21st panzer divisions managed to find their way through the minefields in the centre of the front. early on 27 june, resuming its advance, the 90th light was checked by british 50th division's artillery. meanwhile, the 15th and 21st panzer divisions advanced east above and below the escarpment. the 15th panzer were blocked by 4th armoured and 7th motor brigades, but the 21st panzer were ordered on to attack minqar qaim. rommel ordered 90th light to resume its advance, requiring it to cut the coast road behind 50th division by the evening.[12] as the 21st panzer moved on minqar qaim, the 2nd new zealand division found itself surrounded but broke out on the night of 27/28 june without serious losses and withdrew east.[13] rommel in north africa (june 1942).auchinleck had planned a second delaying position at fuka, some 30 mi (48 km) east of matruh, and at 21:20 he issued the orders for a withdrawal to fuka. confusion in communication led the division withdrawing immediately to the el alamein position.[14] x corps, having made an unsuccessful attempt to secure a position on the escarpment, were out of touch with eighth army from 19:30 until 04:30 the next morning. only then did they discover that the withdrawal order had been given. the withdrawal of xiii corps had left the southern flank of x corps on the coast at matruh exposed and their line of retreat compromised by the cutting of the coastal road 17 mi (27 km) east of matruh. they were ordered to break out southwards into the desert and then make their way east. auchinleck ordered xiii corps to provide support but they were in no position to do so. at 21:00 on 28 june, x corps—organised into brigade groups—headed south. in the darkness, there was considerable confusion as they came across enemy units laagered for the night. in the process, 5th indian division in particular sustained heavy casualties, including the destruction of the 29th indian infantry brigade at fuka.[15] axis forces captured more than 6,000 prisoners, in addition to 40 tanks and an enormous quantity of supplies.[16]prelude[edit]defences at el alamein[edit] the western desert battle area, july 1942.alamein itself was an inconsequential railway station on the coast. some 10 mi (16 km) to the south lay the ruweisat ridge, a low stony prominence that gave excellent observation for many miles over the surrounding desert; 20 mi (32 km) to the south was the qattara depression. the line the british chose to defend stretched between the sea and the depression, which meant that rommel could outflank it only by taking a significant detour to the south and crossing the sahara desert. the british army in egypt recognised this before the war and had the eighth army begin construction of several "boxes" (localities with dug-outs and surrounded by minefields and barbed wire) the most developed being around the railway station at alamein.[17] most of the "line" was open, empty desert.[18] lieutenant-general william norrie (general officer commanding [goc] xxx corps) organised the position and started to construct three defended "boxes". the first and strongest, at el alamein on the coast, had been partly wired and mined by 1st south african division. the bab el qattara box—some 20 mi (32 km) from the coast and 8 mi (13 km) south-west of the ruweisat ridge—had been dug but had not been wired or mined, while at the naq abu dweis box (on the edge of the qattara depression), 34 mi (55 km) from the coast, very little work had been done.[18]the british position in egypt was desperate, the rout from mersa matruh had created a panic in the british headquarters at cairo, something later called "the flap". on what came to be referred to as "ash wednesday", at british headquarters, rear echelon units and the british embassy, papers were hurriedly burned in anticipation of the fall of the city. auchinleck—although believing he could stop rommel at alamein—felt he could not ignore the possibility that he might once more be outmanoeuvred or outfought. to maintain his army, plans must be made for the possibility of a further retreat whilst maintaining morale and retaining the support and co-operation of the egyptians. defensive positions were constructed west of alexandria and on the approaches to cairo while considerable areas in the nile delta were flooded.[19] the axis, too, believed that the capture of egypt was imminent; italian leader benito mussolini—sensing a historic moment—flew to libya to prepare for his triumphal entry into cairo.[20] 25 pdr guns of the 28th field regiment, royal artillery at el alamein, 12 july 1942.the scattering of x corps at mersa matruh disrupted auchinleck's plan for occupying the alamein defences. on 29 june, he ordered xxx corps—the 1st south african, 5th and 10th indian  divisions—to take the coastal sector on the right of the front and xiii corps—the 2nd new zealand division and 4th indian divisions—to be on the left. the remains of the 1st armoured division and the 7th armoured division were to be held as a mobile army reserve.[21] his intention was for the fixed defensive positions to channel and disorganise the enemy's advance while mobile units would attack their flanks and rear.[22]on 30 june, rommel's panzerarmee afrika approached the alamein position. the axis forces were exhausted and understrength. rommel had driven them forward ruthlessly, being confident that, provided he struck quickly before eighth army had time to settle, his momentum would take him through the alamein position and he could then advance to the nile with little further opposition. supplies remained a problem because the axis staff had originally expected a pause of six weeks after the capture of tobruk. german air units were also exhausted and providing little help against the raf's all-out attack on the axis supply lines which, with the arrival of united states army air forces (usaaf) heavy bombers, could reach as far as benghazi.[23] although captured supplies proved useful, water and ammunition were constantly in short supply, while a shortage of transport impeded the distribution of the supplies that the axis forces did have.[24]axis plan of attack[edit]rommel's plan was for the 90th light division and the 15th and 21st panzer divisions of the afrika korps to penetrate the eighth army lines between the alamein box and deir el abyad (which he believed was defended). the 90th light division was then to veer north to cut the coastal road and trap the defenders of the alamein box (which rommel thought was occupied by the remains of the 50th infantry division) and the afrika korps would veer right to attack the rear of xiii corps.battle[edit]an italian division was to attack the alamein box from the west and another was to follow the 90th light division. the italian xx corps was to follow the afrika korps and deal with the qattara box while the 133rd armoured division littorio and german reconnaissance units would protect the right flank.[25] rommel had planned to attack on 30 june but supply and transport difficulties had resulted in a day's delay, vital to the defending forces reorganising on the alamein line. on 30 june, the 90th light division was still 15 miles (24 km) short of its start line, 21st panzer division was immobilised through lack of fuel and the promised air support had yet to move into its advanced airfields.[26]panzer army africa attacks[edit] a panzer ii of the afrika korps.at 03:00 on 1 july, 90th light infantry division advanced east but strayed too far north and ran into the 1st south african division's defences and became pinned down.[25][27] the 15th and 21st panzer divisions of the afrika korps were delayed by a sandstorm and then a heavy air attack. it was broad daylight by the time they circled round the back of deir el abyad where they found the feature to the east of it occupied by 18th indian infantry brigade which, after a hasty journey from iraq, had occupied the exposed position just west of ruweisat ridge and east of deir el abyad at deir el shein late on 28 june to create one of norrie's additional defensive boxes.[28]at about 10:00 on 1 july, 21st panzer division attacked deir el shein. 18th indian infantry brigade—supported by 23 25-pounder gun-howitzers, 16 of the new 6-pounder anti-tank guns and nine matilda tanks—held out the whole day in desperate fighting but by evening the germans succeeded in over-running them.[29] the time they bought allowed auchinleck to organise the defence of the western end of ruweisat ridge.[30] the 1st armoured division had been sent to intervene at deir el shein. they ran into 15th panzer division just south of deir el shein and drove it west. by the end of the day's fighting, the afrika korps had 37 tanks left out of its initial complement of 55.[31]during the early afternoon, 90th light had extricated itself from the el alamein box defences and resumed its move eastward. it came under artillery fire from the three south african brigade groups and was forced to dig in.[31]on 2 july, rommel ordered the resumption of the offensive. once again, 90th light failed to make progress so rommel called the afrika korps to abandon its planned sweep southward and instead join the effort to break through to the coast road by attacking east toward ruweisat ridge. the british defence of ruweisat ridge relied on an improvised formation called "robcol", comprising a regiment each of field artillery and light anti-aircraft artillery and a company of infantry. robcol—in line with normal british army practice for ad hoc formations—was named after its commander, brigadier robert waller, the commander royal artillery of the 10th indian infantry division.[32] robcol was able to buy time, and by late afternoon the two british armoured brigades joined the battle with 4th armoured brigade engaging 15th panzer and 22nd armoured brigade 21st panzer respectively.[33] they drove back repeated attacks by the axis armour, who then withdrew before dusk. the british reinforced ruweisat on the night of 2 july. the now enlarged robcol became "walgroup".[32] meanwhile, the royal air force (raf) made heavy air attacks on the axis units.[34]the next day, 3 july, rommel ordered the afrika korps to resume its attack on the ruweisat ridge with the italian xx motorised corps on its southern flank. italian x corps, meanwhile were to hold el mreir. by this stage the afrika korps had only 26 operational tanks.[35] there was a sharp armoured exchange south of ruweisat ridge during the morning and the main axis advance was held.[35] on 3 july, the raf flew 780 sorties.[d]to relieve the pressure on the right and centre of the eighth army line, xiii corps on the left advanced from the qattara box (known to the new zealanders as the kaponga box). the plan was that the new zealand 2nd division—with the remains of indian 5th division and 7th motor brigade under its command—would swing north to threaten the axis flank and rear.[32] this force encountered the ariete armoured division's artillery, which was driving on the southern flank of the division as it attacked ruweisat. the italian commander ordered his battalions to fight their way out independently but the ariete lost 531 men (about 350 were prisoners), 36 pieces of artillery, six (or eight?) tanks, and 55 trucks.[38] by the end of the day, the ariete division had only five tanks.[39] the day ended once again with the afrika korps and ariete coming off second best to the superior numbers of the british 22nd armoured and 4th armoured brigades,[e] frustrating rommel's attempts to resume his advance.[40] the raf once again played its part, flying 900 sorties during the day.[35]to the south, on 5 july the new zealand group resumed its advance northwards towards el mreir intending to cut the rear of the ariete division. heavy fire from the italian brescia motorised division at el mreir, however, 5 mi (8.0 km) north of the qattara box, checked their progress and led xiii corps to call off its attack.[38]rommel digs in[edit] field marshal erwin rommel, with his aides during the desert campaign, 1942.at this point, rommel decided his exhausted forces could make no further headway without resting and regrouping. he reported to the german high command that his three german divisions numbered just 1,200–1,500 men each and resupply was proving highly problematic because of enemy interference from the air. he expected to have to remain on the defensive for at least two weeks.[41]rommel was by this time suffering from the extended length of his supply lines. the allied desert air force (daf) was concentrating fiercely on his fragile and elongated supply routes while british mobile columns moving west and striking from the south were causing havoc in the axis rear echelons.[42] rommel could afford these losses even less since shipments from italy had been substantially reduced (in june, he received 5,000 short tons (4,500 t) of supplies compared with 34,000 short tons (31,000 t) in may and 400 vehicles (compared with 2,000 in may).[43] meanwhile, the eighth army was reorganising and rebuilding, benefiting from its short lines of communication. by 4 july, the australian 9th division had entered the line in the north, and on 9 july the indian 5th infantry brigade also returned, taking over the ruweisat position. at the same time, the fresh indian 161st infantry brigade reinforced the depleted indian 5th infantry division.[44]tel el eisa[edit]on 8 july, auchinleck ordered the new xxx corps commander—lieutenant-general william ramsden—to capture the low ridges at tel el eisa and tel el makh khad and then to push mobile battle groups south toward deir el shein and raiding parties west toward the airfields at el daba. meanwhile, xiii corps would prevent the axis from moving troops north to reinforce the coastal sector.[45] ramsden tasked the australian 9th division with 44th royal tank regiment under command with the tel el eisa objective and the south african 1st division with eight supporting tanks, tel el makh khad. the raiding parties were to be provided by 1st armoured division.[46] marshal ettore bastico, supreme commander of axis forces in north africa and nominally rommel's superior.following a bombardment which started at 03:30 on 10 july, the australian 26th brigade launched an attack against the ridge north of tel el eisa station along the coast (trig 33). the bombardment was the heaviest barrage yet experienced in north africa, which created panic in the inexperienced soldiers of the italian 60th infantry division sabratha who had only just occupied sketchy defences in the sector.[47][48][49][50] the australian attack took more than 1,500 prisoners, routed an italian division and overran the german signals intercept company 621.[51] meanwhile, the south africans had by late morning taken tel el makh khad and were in covering positions.[46]elements of the german 164th light division and italian 101st motorised division trieste arrived to plug the gap torn in the axis defences.[46][52][53] that afternoon and evening, tanks from the german 15th panzer and italian trieste divisions launched counter-attacks against the australian positions, the counter-attacks failing in the face of overwhelming allied artillery and the australian anti-tank guns.[54][55]at first light on 11 july, the australian 2/24th battalion supported by tanks from 44th royal tank regiment attacked the western end of tel el eisa hill (point 24).[46][56] by early afternoon, the feature was captured and was then held against a series of axis counter-attacks throughout the day. a small column of armour, motorised infantry, and guns then set off to raid deir el abyad and caused a battalion of italian infantry to surrender. its progress was checked at the miteirya ridge and it was forced to withdraw that evening to the el alamein box.[57] during the day, more than 1,000 italian prisoners were taken.[58][59][60]on 12 july, the 21st panzer division launched a counter-attack against trig 33 and point 24, which was beaten off after a 2½-hour fight, with more than 600 german dead and wounded left strewn in front of the australian positions.[60][61] the next day, 21. panzerdivision launched an attack against point 33 and south african positions in the el alamein box.[62] the attack was halted by intense artillery fire from the defenders. rommel was still determined to drive the british forces from the northern salient. although the australian defenders had been forced back from point 24, heavy casualties had been inflicted on 21st panzer division.[63][64][65] another attack was mounted on 15 july but made no ground against tenacious resistance. on 16 july, the australians—supported by british tanks—launched an attack to try to take point 24 but were forced back by german counter-attacks,[66] suffering nearly fifty percent casualties.[67]after seven days of fierce fighting, the battle in the north for tel el eisa salient petered out. australian 9th division estimated at least 2,000 axis troops had been killed and more than 3,700 prisoners of war taken in the battle.[68] possibly the most important feature of the battle, however, was that the australians had captured signals intercept company 621. this unit had provided rommel with priceless intelligence, gleaned from intercepting british radio communications. that source of intelligence was now lost to rommel.[69][70]first battle of ruweisat ridge[edit] a soldier inspects an italian m13/40 tank that was knocked out near el alamein, 11 july 1942 a german 88mm anti-tank gun captured and destroyed by new zealand troops near el alamein, 17 july 1942.as the axis forces dug in, auchinleck—having drawn a number of german units to the coastal sector during the tel el eisa fighting—developed a plan—codenamed operation bacon—to attack the italian pavia and brescia divisions in the centre of the front at the ruweisat ridge.[71] signals intelligence was giving auchinleck clear details of the axis order of battle and force dispositions. his policy was to "...hit the italians wherever possible in view of their low morale and because the germans cannot hold extended fronts without them."[72]the intention was for the 4th new zealand brigade and 5th new zealand brigade (on 4th brigade's right) to attack north-west to seize the western part of the ridge and on their right the indian 5th infantry brigade to capture the eastern part of the ridge in a night attack. then 2nd armoured brigade would pass through the centre of the infantry objectives to exploit toward deir el shein and the miteirya ridge. on the left, the 22nd armoured brigade would be ready to move forward to protect the infantry as they consolidated on the ridge.[73]the attack commenced at 23:00 on 14 july. the two new zealand brigades shortly before dawn on 15 july took their objectives, but minefields and pockets of resistance created disarray among the attackers. a number of pockets of resistance were left behind the forward troops' advance which impeded the move forward of reserves, artillery, and support arms. as a result, the new zealand brigades occupied exposed positions on the ridge without support weapons except for a few anti-tank guns.[74] more significantly, communications with the two british armoured brigades failed, and the british armour did not move forwards to protect the infantry. at first light, a detachment from 15th panzer division's 8th panzer regiment launched a counter-attack against new zealand 4th brigade's 22nd battalion. a sharp exchange knocked out their anti-tank guns and the infantry found themselves exposed in the open with no alternative but to surrender. about 350 new zealanders were taken prisoner.[74]while the 2nd new zealand division attacked the western slopes of ruweisat ridge, the indian 5th brigade made small gains on ruweisat ridge to the east. by 07:00, word was finally got to 2nd armoured brigade which started to move north west. two regiments became embroiled in a minefield but the third was able to join indian 5th infantry 5th brigade as it renewed its attack. with the help of the armour and artillery, the indians were able to take their objectives by early afternoon.[74] meanwhile, the 22nd armoured brigade had been engaged at alam nayil by 90th light division and the ariete armoured division, advancing from the south. while—with help from mobile infantry and artillery columns from 7th armoured division—they pushed back the axis probe with ease, they were prevented from advancing north to protect the new zealand flank.[75]seeing the brescia and pavia under pressure, rommel rushed german troops to ruweisat. by 15:00, the 3rd reconnaissance regiment and part of 21st panzer division from the north and 33rd reconnaissance regiment and the baade group comprising elements from 15th panzer division from the south were in place under lieutenant-general (general der panzertruppe) walther nehring.[76] at 17:00, nehring launched his counter-attack. 4th new zealand brigade were still short of support weapons and also, by this time, ammunition. once again, the anti-tank defences were overwhelmed and about 380 new zealanders were taken prisoner including captain charles upham[76] who gained a second victoria cross for his actions including destroying a german tank and several guns and vehicles with grenades despite being shot through the elbow by a machine gun bullet and having his arm broken. at about 18:00, the brigade hq was overrun. at about 18:15, 2nd armoured brigade engaged the german armour and halted the axis eastward advance. at dusk, nehring broke off the action.[76]early on 16 july, nehring renewed his attack. the 5th indian infantry brigade pushed them back but it was clear from intercepted radio traffic that a further attempt would be made. strenuous preparations to dig in anti-tank guns were made, artillery fire plans organised and a regiment from the 22nd armoured brigade was sent to reinforce the 2nd armoured brigade.[75] when the attack resumed late in the afternoon, it was repulsed. after the battle, the indians counted 24 knocked out tanks, as well as armoured cars and numerous anti-tank guns left on the battlefield.[77][78]in three days' fighting, the allies took more than 2,000 axis prisoners, mostly from the italian brescia and pavia divisions; the new zealand division suffered 1,405 casualties.[79][80] the fighting at tel el eisa and ruweisat had caused the destruction of three italian divisions, forced rommel to redeploy his armour from the south, made it necessary to lay minefields in front of the remaining italian divisions and stiffen them with detachments of german troops.[81]miteirya ridge (ruin ridge)[edit]to relieve pressure on ruweisat ridge, auchinleck ordered the australian 9th division to make another attack from the north. in the early hours of 17 july, the australian 24th brigade—supported by 44th royal tank regiment (rtr) and strong fighter cover from the air—assaulted miteirya ridge[75] (known as "ruin ridge" to the australians). the initial night attack went well, with 736 prisoners taken, mostly from the italian trento and trieste motorised divisions. once again, however, a critical situation for the axis forces was retrieved by vigorous counter-attacks from hastily assembled german and italian forces, which forced the australians to withdraw back to their start line with 300 casualties.[75][82][83][84] although the australian official history of the 24th brigade's 2/32nd battalion describes the counter-attack force as "german",[85] the australian historian mark johnston reports that german records indicate that it was the trento division that overran the australian battalion.[86][f]second battle of ruweisat ridge (el mreir)[edit] a 25-pdr field gun of 11th field regiment, royal artillery, in action, july 1942.the eighth army now enjoyed a massive superiority in material over the axis forces: 1st armoured division had 173 tanks and more in reserve or in transit,[88] including 61 grants[81] while rommel possessed only 38 german tanks and 51 italian tanks[89][90] although his armoured units had some 100 tanks awaiting repair.[88]auchinleck’s plan was for indian infantry 161st brigade to attack along ruweisat ridge to take deir el shein, while the new zealand 6th brigade attacked from south of the ridge to the el mreir depression. at daylight, two british armoured brigades—2nd armoured brigade and the fresh 23rd armoured brigade—would sweep through the gap created by the infantry. the plan was complicated and ambitious.[91]the infantry night attack began at 16:30 on 21 july. the new zealand attack took their objectives in the el mreir depression[92] but, once again, many vehicles failed to arrive and they were short of support arms in an exposed position. at daybreak on 22 july, the british armoured brigades again failed to advance. at daybreak on 22 july, nehring's 5th and 8th panzer regiments responded with a rapid counter-attack which quickly overran the new zealand infantry in the open, inflicting more than 900 casualties on the new zealanders.[93] 2nd armoured brigade sent forward two regiments to help but they were halted by mines and anti-tank fire.[94]the attack by indian 161st brigade had mixed fortunes. on the left, the initial attempt to clear the western end of ruweisat failed but at 08:00 a renewed attack by the reserve battalion succeeded. on the right, the attacking battalion broke into the deir el shein position but was driven back in hand-to-hand fighting.[94]compounding the disaster at el mreir, at 08:00 the commander of 23rd armoured brigade ordered his brigade forward, intent on following his orders to the letter. major-general gatehouse—commanding 1st armoured division—had been unconvinced that a path had been adequately cleared in the minefields and had suggested the advance be cancelled.[95] however, xiii corps commander—lieutenant-general william gott—rejected this and ordered the attack but on a centre line 1 mi (1.6 km) south of the original plan which he incorrectly believed was mine-free. these orders failed to get through and the attack went ahead as originally planned. the brigade found itself mired in mine fields and under heavy fire. they were then counter-attacked by 21st panzer at 11:00 and forced to withdraw.[95] the 23rd armoured brigade was destroyed, with the loss of 40 tanks destroyed and 47 badly damaged.[95]at 17:00, gott ordered 5th indian infantry division to execute a night attack to capture the western half of ruweisat ridge and deir el shein. 3/14th punjab regiment from 9th indian infantry brigade attacked at 02:00 on 23 july but failed as they lost their direction. a further attempt in daylight succeeded in breaking into the position but intense fire from three sides resulted in control being lost as the commanding officer was killed, and four of his senior officers were wounded or went missing.[96]attack on tel el eisa resumed[edit] destroyed panzer iiis near tel el eisato the north, australian 9th division continued its attacks. at 06:00 on 22 july, australian 26th brigade attacked tel el eisa and australian 24th brigade attacked tel el makh khad toward miteirya (ruin ridge).[96] it was during this fighting that arthur stanley gurney performed the actions for which he was posthumously awarded the victoria cross. the fighting for tel el eisa was costly, but by the afternoon the australians controlled the feature.[96][97][98] that evening, australian 24th brigade attacked tel el makh khad with the tanks of 50th rtr in support. the tank unit had not been trained in close infantry support and failed to co-ordinate with the australian infantry. the result was that the infantry and armour advanced independently and having reached the objective 50th rtr lost 23 tanks because they lacked infantry support.[96][99][100]once more, the eighth army had failed to destroy rommel’s forces, despite its overwhelming superiority in men and equipment. on the other hand, for rommel the situation continued to be grave as, despite successful defensive operations, his infantry had suffered heavy losses and he reported that "the situation is critical in the extreme".[101]operation manhood[edit]on 26/27 july, auchinleck launched operation manhood in the northern sector in a final attempt to break the axis forces. xxx corps was reinforced with 1st armoured division (less 22nd armoured brigade), 4th light armoured brigade, and 69th infantry brigade. the plan was to break the enemy line south of miteirya ridge and exploit north-west. the south africans were to make and mark a gap in the minefields to the south-east of miteirya by midnight of 26/27 july.[96] by 01:00 on 27 july, 24th australian infantry brigade was to have captured the eastern end of the miteirya ridge and would exploit toward the north-west. the 69th infantry brigade would pass through the minefield gap created by the south africans to deir el dhib and clear and mark gaps in further minefields. the 2nd armoured brigade would then pass through to el wishka and would be followed by 4th light armoured brigade which would attack the axis lines of communication.[102] a valentine in north africa, carrying british infantrythis was the third attempt to break through in the northern sector, and the axis defenders were expecting the attack.[103] like the previous attacks, it was hurriedly and therefore poorly planned.[104] the australian 24th brigade managed to take their objectives on miteirya ridge by 02:00[g] of 27 july.[105] to the south, the british 69th brigade set off at 01:30 and managed to take their objectives by about 08:00. however, the supporting anti-tank units became lost in the darkness or delayed by minefields, leaving the attackers isolated and exposed when daylight came. there followed a period during which reports from the battlefront regarding the minefield gaps were confused and conflicting. as a consequence, the advance of 2nd armoured brigade was delayed.[102][106] rommel launched an immediate counter-attack and the german armoured battlegroups overran the two forward battalions of 69th brigade.[102][107] meanwhile, 50th rtr supporting the australians was having difficulty locating the minefield gaps made by australian 2/24th battalion. they failed to find a route through and in the process were caught by heavy fire and lost 13 tanks. the unsupported 2/28th australian battalion on the ridge was overrun. the 69th brigade suffered 600 casualties and the australians 400 for no gain.[102]the eighth army was exhausted, and on 31 july auchinleck ordered an end to offensive operations and the strengthening of the defences to meet a major counter-offensive. commemorative stone put up by the 7th bersaglieri regiment on the road from alexandria to el alamein at the high-water mark for the italian advance. the inscription reads: mancò la fortuna, non il valore (a lack of fortune, not of valour).rommel was later to blame the failure to break through to the nile on how the sources of supply to his army had dried up and how:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}then the power of resistance of many italian formations collapsed. the duties of comradeship, for me particularly as their commander-in-chief, compel me to state unequivocally that the defeats which the italian formations suffered at alamein in early july were not the fault of the italian soldier. the italian was willing, unselfish and a good comrade, and, considering the conditions under which he served, had always given better than average. there is no doubt that the achievement of every italian unit, especially of the motorised forces, far surpassed anything that the italian army had done for a hundred years. many italian generals and officers won our admiration both as men and as soldiers. the cause of the italian defeat had its roots in the whole italian military state and system, in their poor armament and in the general lack of interest in the war by many italians, both officers and statesmen. this italian failure frequently prevented the realisation of my plans.— rommel[108]rommel complained bitterly about the failure of important italian convoys to get through to him desperately needed tanks and supplies, always blaming the italian supreme command, never suspecting british code breaking.[109]according to dr james sadkovich and others, rommel often displayed a distinct tendency to blame and scapegoat his italian allies to cover up his own mistakes and deficiencies as a commander in the field.[110][111] for example, while rommel was a very good tactical commander, the italian and german high commands  were concerned that he lacked operational awareness and a sense of strategic objectives.[112]  dr sadkovich points out that he would often out-run his logistics and squander valuable (mostly italian) military hardware and  resources in battle after battle without clear strategic goals and an appreciation of the limited logistics his italian allies were desperately trying to provide him.[110]aftermath[edit]the battle was a stalemate, but it had halted the axis advance on alexandria (and then cairo and ultimately the suez canal). the eighth army had suffered over 13,000 casualties in july, including 4,000 in the 2nd new zealand division, 3,000 in the 5th indian infantry division and 2,552 battle casualties in the 9th australian division but had taken 7,000 prisoners and inflicted heavy damage on axis men and machines.[5][67] in his appreciation of 27 july, auchinleck wrote that the eighth army would not be ready to attack again until mid-september at the earliest. he believed that because rommel understood that with the passage of time the allied situation would only improve, he was compelled to attack as soon as possible and before the end of august when he would have superiority in armour. auchinleck therefore made plans for a defensive battle.[113]in early august, winston churchill and general sir alan brooke—the chief of the imperial general staff (cigs)—visited cairo on their way to meet joseph stalin in moscow. they decided to replace auchinleck, appointing the xiii corps commander, william gott, to the eighth army command and general sir harold alexander as c-in-c middle east command. persia and iraq were to be split from middle east command as a separate persia and iraq command and auchinleck was offered the post of c-in-c (which he refused).[114] gott was killed on the way to take up his command when his aircraft was shot down.[115] lieutenant-general bernard montgomery was appointed in his place and took command on 13 august.[5][h]see also[edit]world war ii portalnorth african campaign timelinelist of world war ii battleslist of world war ii north africa airfieldsbattle of alam el halfasecond battle of el alameinalamein memorialnotes[edit]^ reported strength on 30 june (55 german and 15 italian tanks). an unknown number of tanks were also in repair workshops behind the front.^ strength at the frontline on 1 july. in addition 902 tanks were in repair workshops behind the front, of which 34 were serviceable and many unrepairable. ^ ghq cairo estimated that the axis could have as many as 519 serviceable tanks on 30 june although 339 was a more probable figure. in fact the actual number on 26 june was 104 compared with 155 tanks in eighth army[11]^ during the period 1 to 27 june the desert air force flew nearly 15,400 sorties.[36] auchinleck later wrote in his official despatches "...our air forces could not have done more than they did to help and sustain the eighth army in its struggle. their effort was continuous by day and night, and the effect on the enemy was tremendous. i am certain that, had it not been for their devoted and exceptional efforts, we should not have been able to stop the enemy on the el alamein position."[37]^ the two british armoured brigades started on 3 july with a total strength of 119 tanks[35]^ barton maughan—australia's official historian—has written that "two forward platoons of the 2/32nd's left company were overrun, 22 men were taken prisoner"[87] but fails to shed more light on this attack.^ playfair states that the "...timing soon fell behind, but by 3 am the australians had taken their objective"[102]^ brooke and auchinleck had both thought montgomery a better candidate than gott but churchill had favoured his appointment.[116]citations[edit]^ barr, p. 39^ barr, p. 40^ watson 2007, p. 6^ barr, p. 184^ a b c d mackenzie 1951, p. 589^ playfair vol. iii, p. 279^ playfair vol. iii, pp. 281n and 283^ playfair

forcenumber builtestimated 6,500[a]the junkers ju 87 or stuka (from sturzkampfflugzeug, "dive bomber") was a german dive bomber and ground-attack aircraft. designed by hermann pohlmann, it first flew in 1935. the ju 87 made its combat debut in 1937 with the luftwaffe's condor legion during the spanish civil war and served the axis forces in world war ii.the aircraft was easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs were mounted the jericho-trompete (jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of german air power and the blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942. the stuka's design included several innovations, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings to ensure that the aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces.the stuka operated with considerable success in close air support and anti-shipping at the outbreak of world war ii. it led air assaults in the invasion of poland in september 1939.  stukas were critical to the rapid conquest of norway, the netherlands, belgium and france in 1940. sturdy, accurate, and very effective against ground targets, the stuka was, like many other dive bombers of the period, vulnerable to fighter aircraft. during the battle of britain its lack of manoeuvrability, speed and defensive armament meant that it required a heavy fighter escort to operate effectively.  after the battle of britain the stuka was used in the balkans campaign, the african and mediterranean theatres and the early stages of the eastern front where it was used for general ground support, as an effective specialised anti-tank aircraft and in an anti-shipping role.  once the luftwaffe lost air superiority, the stuka became an easy target for enemy fighter aircraft on all fronts. it was produced until 1944 for lack of a better replacement. by then ground-attack versions of the focke-wulf fw 190 had largely replaced the stuka, but stukas remained in service until the end of the war.an estimated 6,500 ju 87s of all versions were built between 1936 and august 1944.oberst hans-ulrich rudel

reading13 external linksdevelopment[edit]early design[edit]the ju 87's principal designer, hermann pohlmann, held the opinion that any dive-bomber design needed to be simple and robust.[1] this led to many technical innovations, such as the retractable undercarriage being discarded in favour of one of the stuka's distinctive features, its fixed and "spatted" undercarriage. pohlmann continued to carry on developing and adding to his ideas and those of dipl ing karl plauth (plauth was killed in a flying accident in november 1927), and produced the ju a 48 which underwent testing on 29 september 1928. the military version of the ju a 48 was designated the ju k 47.[1] ernst udet; the greatest proponent of the dive-bomber and the ju 87 (photo 1928)after the nazis came to power, the design was given priority. despite initial competition from the henschel hs 123, the reichsluftfahrtministerium (rlm, the german aviation ministry) turned to the designs of herman pohlmann of junkers and co-designer of the k 47, karl plauth. during the trials with the k 47 in 1932, the double vertical stabilisers were introduced to give the rear gunner a better field of fire. the main, and what was to be the most distinctive, feature of the ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.[2]after plauth's death, pohlmann continued the development of the junkers dive bomber. the ju a 48 registration d-itor, was originally fitted with a bmw 132 engine, producing 450 kw (600 hp). the machine was also fitted with dive brakes for dive testing. the aircraft was given a good evaluation and "exhibited very good flying characteristics".[1]ernst udet took an immediate liking to the concept of dive-bombing after flying the curtiss f11c goshawk. when walther wever and robert ritter von greim were invited to watch udet perform a trial flight in may 1934 at the jüterbog artillery range, it raised doubts about the capability of the dive bomber. udet began his dive at 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and released his 1 kg (2.2 lb) bombs at 100 m (330 ft), barely recovering and pulling out of the dive.[3] the chief of the luftwaffe command office walther wever, and the secretary of state for aviation erhard milch, feared that such high-level nerves and skill could not be expected of "average pilots" in the luftwaffe.[3] nevertheless, development continued at junkers.[3] udet's "growing love affair" with the dive bomber pushed it to the forefront of german aviation development.[4] udet went so far as to advocate that all medium bombers should have dive-bombing capabilities,[5] which initially doomed the only dedicated, strategic heavy bomber design to enter german front-line service during the war years—the 30-metre wingspan he 177a—into having an airframe design (due to udet examining its design details in november 1937) that could perform "medium angle" dive-bombing missions, until reichsmarschall hermann göring exempted the he 177a, germany's only operational heavy bomber, in september 1942 from being given the task of such a mismatched mission profile for its large airframe.[6]evolution[edit]the design of the ju 87 had begun in 1933 as part of the sturzbomber-programm. the ju 87 was to be powered by the british rolls-royce kestrel engine. ten engines were ordered by junkers on 19 april 1934 for £20,514, two shillings and sixpence.[7]the first ju 87 prototype was built by ab flygindustri [sv] in sweden and secretly brought to germany in late 1934. it was to have been completed in april 1935, but, due to the inadequate strength of the airframe, construction took until october 1935. the mostly complete ju 87 v1 w.nr.c  4921 (less non-essential parts) took off for its maiden flight on 17 september 1935. the aircraft was later given the registration d-ubyr.[8] the flight report, by hauptmann willy neuenhofen, stated the only problem was with the small radiator, which caused the engine to overheat.[9]the ju 87 v1, powered by a rolls-royce kestrel v12 cylinder liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 january 1936 at kleutsch near dresden, killing junkers' chief test pilot, willy neuenhofen, and his engineer, heinrich kreft.[10] the square twin fins and rudders proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an inverted spin during the testing of the terminal dynamic pressure in a dive.[11] the crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. to withstand strong forces during a dive, heavy plating was fitted, along with brackets riveted to the frame and longeron, to the fuselage. other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.[12] the stuka had inverted gull wings, as shown in this photograph. also visible are the two separate sliding "hoods" of the canopy.the rlm was still not interested in the ju 87 and was not impressed that it relied on a british engine. in late 1935, junkers suggested fitting a db 600 inverted v-12 engine, with the final variant to be equipped with the jumo 210. this was accepted by the rlm as an interim solution. the reworking of the design began on 1 january 1936. the test flight could not be carried out for over two months due to a lack of adequate aircraft. the 24 january crash had already destroyed one machine.the second prototype was also beset by design problems. it had its twin stabilisers removed and a single tail fin installed due to fears over stability. due to a shortage of engines, instead of a db 600, a bmw "hornet" engine was fitted. all these delays set back testing until 25 february 1936.[13] by march 1936, the second prototype, the v2, was finally fitted with the jumo 210aa engine, which a year later was replaced by a jumo 210 g (w.nr. 19310). although the testing went well, and the pilot, flight captain hesselbach, praised its performance, wolfram von richthofen told the junkers representative and construction office chief engineer ernst zindel that the ju 87 stood little chance of becoming the luftwaffe's main dive bomber, as it was underpowered in his opinion. on 9 june 1936, the rlm ordered cessation of development in favour of the heinkel he 118, a rival design. udet cancelled the order the next day, and development continued.[14]on 27 july 1936, udet crashed the he 118 prototype, he 118 v1 d-ukym.[15] that same day, charles lindbergh was visiting ernst heinkel, so heinkel could only communicate with udet by telephone. according to this version of the story, heinkel warned udet about the propeller's fragility. udet failed to consider this, so in a dive, the engine oversped and the propeller broke away.[16] immediately after this incident, udet announced the stuka the winner of the development contest.[15]honing the design[edit]despite being chosen, the design was still lacking and drew frequent criticism from wolfram von richthofen. testing of the v4 prototype (a ju 87 a-0) in early 1937 revealed several problems. the ju 87 could take off in 250 m (820 ft) and climb to 1,875 m (6,152 ft) in eight minutes with a 250 kg (550 lb) bomb load, and its cruising speed was 250 km/h (160 mph). richthofen pushed for a more powerful engine.[17] according to the test pilots, the heinkel he 50 had a better acceleration rate, and could climb away from the target area much more quickly, avoiding enemy ground and air defences. richthofen stated that any maximum speed below 350 km/h (220 mph) was unacceptable for those reasons. pilots also complained that navigation and powerplant instruments were mixed together, and were not easy to read, especially in combat. despite this, pilots praised the aircraft's handling qualities and strong airframe.[18]these problems were to be resolved by installing the daimler-benz db 600 engine, but delays in development forced the installation of the jumo 210 d inverted v-12 engine. flight testing began on 14 august 1936. subsequent testing and progress fell short of richthofen's hopes, although the machine's speed was increased to 280 km/h (170 mph) at ground level and 290 km/h (180 mph) at 1,250 m (4,100 ft), while maintaining its good handling ability.[19]during ww2, a number of ju87 aircraft were fitted with one or two electrically motor driven cameras to assess aiming accuracy and bomb damage. in the belly of the aircraft, a leica 250 reporter, motor-driven (12 or 24 volts) was used to assess aiming accuracy. these would be started automatically when the airbrakes were applied. in the tail, a smaller robot (24 x 24mm images) electric motor drive camera was fitted to assess the bomb damage. these had to be switched on manually by the pilot after bomb release. in the heat of the moment, this was frequently omitted. there was a shortage of the leica 250 cameras, given that only 988 of these specialist cameras had been made between 1933 and 1943 and a significant number exported pre-war, so a number were repossessed from axis civilian owners. design[edit]basic design (based on the b series)[edit] junkers jumo 211 inverted v12 powerplant on an aircraft undergoing repair (north africa, 1941)the ju 87 was a single-engined all-metal cantilever monoplane. it had a fixed undercarriage and could carry a two-person crew. the main construction material was duralumin, and the external coverings were made of duralumin sheeting. parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of pantal (a german aluminium alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of elektron. bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.[20]the ju 87 was fitted with detachable hatches and removable coverings to aid and ease maintenance and overhaul. the designers avoided welding parts wherever possible, preferring moulded and cast parts instead. large airframe segments were interchangeable as a complete unit, which increased speed of repair.[20] stuka engine and wingthe airframe was also subdivided into sections to allow transport by road or rail. the wings were of standard junkers double-wing construction. this gave the ju 87 considerable advantage on take-off; even at a shallow angle, large lift forces were created through the aerofoil, reducing take-off and landing runs.[20]in accordance with the aircraft certification centre for "stress group 5", the ju 87 had reached the acceptable structural strength requirements for a dive bomber. it was able to withstand diving speeds of 600 km/h (370 mph) and a maximum level speed of 340 km/h (210 mph) near ground level, and a flying weight of 4,300 kg (9,500 lb). performance in the diving attack was enhanced by the introduction of dive brakes under each wing, which allowed the ju 87 to maintain a constant speed and allow the pilot to steady his aim. it also prevented the crew from suffering extreme g forces and high acceleration during "pull-out" from the dive.[20]the fuselage had an oval cross-section and housed, in most examples, a junkers jumo 211 water-cooled inverted v-12 engine. the cockpit was protected from the engine by a firewall ahead of the wing centre section where the fuel tanks were located. at the rear of the cockpit, the bulkhead was covered by a canvas cover which could be breached by the crew in an emergency, enabling them to escape into the main fuselage. the canopy was split into two sections and joined by a strong welded steel frame. the canopy itself was made of plexiglas and each compartment had its own "sliding hood" for the two crew members.[20]the engine was mounted on two main support frames that were supported by two tubular struts. the frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. the main frames were bolted onto the engine's top quarter. in turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. the firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. all conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.[21]the fuel system comprised two fuel tanks between the main (forward) and rear spars of the (inner) anhedral wing section of the port and starboard wings, each with 240-litre (63 us gal) capacity.[22] the tanks also had a predetermined limit which, if passed, would warn the pilot via a red warning light in the cockpit. the fuel was injected via a pump from the tanks to the engine. should this shut down, it could be pumped manually using a hand-pump on the fuel cock armature.[21] the powerplant was cooled by a 10-litre (2.6 us gal), ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. a further container of 20-litre (5.3 us gal) was positioned under the engine.[21]the control surfaces operated in much the same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. the pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the control column and taking manual control.[23] the ju 87 at the raf museum, london, with its wing outer sections temporarily detached, may 2016the wing was the most unusual feature. it consisted of a single centre section and two outer sections installed using four universal joints. the centre section had a large negative dihedral (anhedral) and the outer surfaces a positive dihedral. this created the inverted gull, or "cranked", wing pattern along the ju 87's leading edge. the shape of the wing improved the pilot's ground visibility and also allowed a shorter undercarriage height. the centre section protruded by only 3 m (9 ft 10 in) on either side.[23]the offensive armament was two 7.92 mm (.312 in) mg 17 machine guns fitted one in each wing outboard of undercarriage, operated by a mechanical pneumatics system from the pilot's control column. the rear gunner/radio operator operated one 7.92 mm (.312 in) mg 15 machine gun for defensive purposes.[20]the engine and propeller had automatic controls, and an auto-trimmer made the aircraft tail-heavy as the pilot rolled over into his dive, lining up red lines at 60°, 75° or 80° on the cockpit side window with the horizon and aiming at the target with the sight of the fixed gun. the heavy bomb was swung down clear of the propeller on crutches prior to release.[24]diving procedure[edit] ju 87 diving procedureflying at 4,600 m (15,100 ft), the pilot located his target through a bombsight window in the cockpit floor. the pilot moved the dive lever to the rear, limiting the "throw" of the control column.[25] the dive brakes were activated automatically, the pilot set the trim tabs, reduced his throttle and closed the coolant flaps. the aircraft then rolled 180°, automatically nosing the aircraft into a dive. red tabs protruded from the upper surfaces of the wing as a visual indicator to the pilot that, in case of a g-induced black-out, the automatic dive recovery system would be activated. the stuka dived at a 60–90° angle, holding a constant speed of 500–600 km/h (350–370 mph) due to dive-brake deployment, which increased the accuracy of the ju 87's aim.[25]when the aircraft was reasonably close to the target, a light on the contact altimeter came on to indicate the bomb-release point, usually at a minimum height of 450 m (1,480 ft). the pilot released the bomb and initiated the automatic pull-out mechanism by depressing a knob on the control column.[25] an elongated u-shaped crutch located under the fuselage swung the bomb out of the way of the propeller, and the aircraft automatically began a 6g pullout.[25] once the nose was above the horizon, dive brakes were retracted, the throttle was opened, and the propeller was set to climb. the pilot regained control and resumed normal flight. the coolant flaps had to be reopened quickly to prevent overheating. the automatic pull-out was not liked by all pilots. helmut mahlke later said that he and his unit disconnected the system because it allowed the enemy to predict the ju 87's recovery pattern and height, making it easier for ground defences to hit an aircraft.[26]physical stress on the crew was severe. human beings subjected to more than 5g in a seated position will suffer vision impairment in the form of a grey veil known to stuka pilots as "seeing stars". they lose vision while remaining conscious; after five seconds, they black out. the ju 87 pilots experienced the visual impairments most during "pull-up" from a dive.[27]eric "winkle" brown rn, a british test pilot and commanding officer of no. 1426 flight raf (the captured enemy aircraft flight), tested the ju 87 at rae farnborough. he said of the stuka, "i had flown a lot of dive-bombers and it’s the only one that you can dive truly vertically. sometimes with the dive-bombers...maximum dive is usually in the order of 60 degrees.. when flying the stuka, because it’s all automatic, you are really flying vertically... the stuka was in a class of its own."[28]g-force test at dessau[edit]extensive tests were carried out by the junkers works at their dessau plant. it was discovered that the highest load a pilot could endure was 8.5g for three seconds, when the aircraft was pushed to its limit by the centrifugal forces. at less than 4g, no visual problems or loss of consciousness were experienced.[29] above 6g, 50% of pilots suffered visual problems, or "greyout". with 40%, vision vanished altogether from 7.5g upwards and black-out sometimes occurred.[30] despite this blindness, the pilot could maintain consciousness and was capable of "bodily reactions". after more than three seconds, half the subjects passed out. the pilot would regain consciousness two or three seconds after the centrifugal forces had dropped below 3g and had lasted no longer than three seconds. in a crouched position, pilots could withstand 7.5g and were able to remain functional for a short duration. in this position, junkers concluded that ⅔ of pilots could withstand 8g and perhaps 9g for three to five seconds without vision defects which, under war conditions, was acceptable.[31]during tests with the ju 87 a-2, new technologies were tried out to reduce the effects of g. the pressurised cabin was of great importance during this research. testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. this new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. when the united states army occupied the junkers factory at dessau on 21 april 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the ju 87.[31]other designs[edit]the concept of dive bombing became so popular among the leadership of the luftwaffe that it became almost obligatory in new aircraft designs. later bomber models like the junkers ju 88 and the dornier do 217 were equipped for dive bombing. the heinkel he 177 strategic bomber was initially supposed to have dive bombing capabilities, a requirement that contributed to the failure of the design,[32] with the requirement not rescinded until september 1942 by reichsmarschall hermann göring.[6]once the stuka became too vulnerable to fighter opposition on all fronts, work was done to develop a replacement. none of the dedicated close-support designs on the drawing board progressed far due to the impact of the war and technological difficulties. so the luftwaffe settled on the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter aircraft, with the fw 190f becoming the ground-attack version. the fw 190f started to replace the ju 87 for day missions in 1943, but the ju 87 continued to be used as a night nuisance-raider until the end of the war.[33]variants[edit]ju 87a[edit] formation of ju 87a dive-bombers, with the a's characteristic large wheel "trousers", each having one transverse bracing strutthe second prototype had a redesigned single vertical stabiliser and a 610 ps (601.7 hp; 448.7 kw) junkers jumo 210 a engine installed, and later the jumo 210da. the first a series variant, the a-0, was of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit under a "greenhouse" well-framed canopy; bearing twin radio masts on its aft sections, diagonally mounted to either side of the airframe's planform centreline and unique to the -a version. to ease the difficulty of mass production, the leading edge of the wing was straightened out and the ailerons' two aerofoil sections had smooth leading and trailing edges. the pilot could adjust the elevator and rudder trim tabs in flight, and the tail was connected to the landing flaps, which were positioned in two parts between the ailerons and fuselage. the a-0 also had a flatter engine cowling, which gave the pilot a much better field of vision. in order for the engine cowling to be flattened, the engine was set down nearly 0.25 m (9.8 in). the fuselage was also lowered along with the gunner's position, allowing the gunner a better field of fire.[34]the rlm ordered seven a-0s initially, but then increased the order to 11. early in 1937, the a-0 was tested with varied bomb loads. the underpowered jumo 210a, as pointed out by von richthofen, was insufficient, and was quickly replaced with the jumo 210d engine.[34]the a-1 differed from the a-0 only slightly.[35] as well as the installation of the jumo 210d, the a-1 had two 220 l (58 us gal; 48 imp gal) fuel tanks built into the inner wing, but it was not armoured or protected.[35] the a-1 was also intended to be fitted with four 7.92 mm (0.312 in) mg 17 machine guns in its wings, but two of these—one per side—were omitted due to weight concerns; the pair that remained were fed a total of 500 rounds of ammunition, stored in the design's characteristic transverse strut-braced, large-planform undercarriage "trousers", not used on the ju 87b versions and onward. the pilot relied on the revi c 21c gun sight for the two mg 17s. the gunner had a single 7.92 mm (0.312 in) mg 15 machine gun, with 14 drums of ammunition, each containing 75 rounds. this represented a 150-round increase in this area over the ju 87 a-0. the a-1 was also fitted with a larger 3.3 m (11 ft) propeller.[35]the ju 87 was capable of carrying a 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb, but only if not carrying the rear gunner/radio operator as, even with the jumo 210d, the ju 87 was still underpowered for operations with more than a 250 kg (550 lb) bomb load. all ju 87 as were restricted to 250 kg (550 lb) weapons (although during the spanish civil war missions were conducted without the gunner).[36]the ju 87 a-2 was retrofitted with the jumo 210da fitted with a two-stage supercharger. the only further significant difference between the a-1 and a-2 was the h-pa-iii controllable-pitch propeller.[37] by mid-1938, 262 ju 87 as had been produced, 192 from the junkers factory in dessau, and a further 70 from weser flugzeugbau ("weserflug" – wfg) in lemwerder near bremen. the new, more powerful, ju 87b model started to replace the ju 87a at this time.[38]prototypes[39]ju 87 v1 : w.nr 4921. flown on 17 september 1935ju 87 v2 : w.nr 4922, registration d-idqr. flown on 25 february

improved 680 ps (500 kw or 670 hp) jumo 210e engine.ju 87b[edit] junkers ju 87 b during the battle of stalingradthe ju 87 b series was to be the first mass-produced variant. a total of six pre-production ju 87 b-0 were produced, built from ju 87 an airframes.[41]the first production version was the ju 87 b-1, with a considerably larger engine, its junkers jumo 211d generating 1,200 ps (883 kw or 1,184 hp), and completely redesigned fuselage and landing gear, replacing the twin radio masts of the "a" version with a single mast mounted further forward on the "greenhouse" canopy, and much simpler, lighter-weight wheel "spats" used from the -b version onwards, discarding the transverse strut bracing of the "a" version's maingear design. this new design was again tested in spain, and after proving its abilities there, production was ramped up to 60 per month. as a result, by the outbreak of world war ii, the luftwaffe had 336 ju 87 b-1s on hand.[25]the b-1 was also fitted with "jericho trumpets", essentially propeller-driven sirens with a diameter of 0.7 m (2.3 ft)[42] mounted on the wing's leading edge directly forward of the landing gear, or on the front edge of the fixed main gear fairing. this was used to weaken enemy morale and enhance the intimidation of dive-bombing. after the enemy became used to it they were withdrawn. the devices caused a loss of 20–25 km/h (10–20 mph) through drag. instead, some bombs were fitted with whistles on the fin to produce the noise after release.[43] the trumpets were a suggestion from generaloberst ernst udet (but some authors say the idea originated from adolf hitler).[44]the ju 87 b-2s that followed had some improvements and were built in several variants that included ski-equipped versions (the b-1 also had this modification)[45] and at the other end, with a tropical operation kit called the ju 87 b-2 trop. italy's regia aeronautica received b-2s and named them the "picchiatello", while others went to the other members of the axis, including hungary, bulgaria and romania. the b-2 also had an oil hydraulic system for closing the cowling flaps. this continued in all the later designs.[46]production of the ju 87 b started in 1937. 89 b-1s were to be built at junkers' factory in dessau and another 40 at the weserflug plant in lemwerder by july 1937. production would be carried out by the weserflug company after april 1938, but junkers continued producing ju 87 up until march 1940.[47]ju 87r[edit] a standard 300 litre drop tank from a bf 109 – similar in appearance to those used by the ju 87r.a long range version of the ju 87b was also built, known as the ju 87r, the letter being an abbreviation for reichweite, "(operational) range". they were primarily intended for anti-shipping missions. the ju 87r had a b-series airframe with an additional oil tank and fuel lines to the outer wing stations to permit the use of two 300 litres (79 us gal) standardised capacity under-wing drop tanks, used by a wide variety of luftwaffe aircraft through most of the war. this increased fuel capacity to 1,080 litres (290 us gal) (500 litres in main fuel tank of which 480 litres were usable + 600 litres from drop tanks). to prevent overload conditions, bomb carrying ability was often restricted to a single 250 kg (550 lb) bomb if the aircraft was fully loaded with fuel.the ju 87 r-1 had a b-1 airframe with the exception of a modification in the fuselage which enabled an additional oil tank. this was installed to feed the engine due to the increase in range with the extra fuel tanks.[48] a ju-87 towing a dfs 230 over italythe ju 87 r-2 had the same airframe as the b-2, and strengthened to ensure it could withstand dives of 600 km/h (370 mph). the jumo 211d in-line engine was installed, replacing the r-1s jumo 211a.[48] due to an increase in overall weight by 700 kg (1,500 lb), the ju 87 r-2 was 30 km/h (19 mph) slower than the ju 87 b-1 and had a lower service ceiling. the ju 87 r-2 had an increased range advantage of 360 km (220 mi).[47] the r-3 and r-4 were the last r variants developed. only a few were built. the r-3 was an experimental tug for gliders and had an expanded radio system so the crew could communicate with the glider crew by way of the tow rope. the r-4 differed from the r-2 in the jumo 211j powerplant.[49] the powerplant; a jumo 211d

code of gt+ax.ju 87 v17 and ju 87 v18 may never have been built.[41]ju 87c[edit]on 18 august 1937, the rlm decided to introduce the ju 87 tr(c). the ju 87 c was intended to be a dive and torpedo bomber for the kriegsmarine. the type was ordered into prototype production and available for testing in january 1938. testing was given two months and was to begin in february and end in april 1938.[51] the prototype v10 was to be a fixed wing test aircraft, while the following v11 would be modified with folding wings. the prototypes were ju 87 b-0 airframes powered by jumo 211 a engines.[51] owing to delays, the v10 was not completed until march 1938. it first flew on 17 march and was designated ju 87 c-1.[51] on 12 may, the v11 also flew for the first time. by 15 december 1939, 915 arrested landings on dry land had been made. it was found that the arresting gear winch was too weak and had to be replaced. tests showed the average braking distance was 20–35 metres (66–115 ft).[52]the ju 87 v11 was designated c-0 on 8 october 1938. it was fitted out with standard ju 87 c-0 equipment and better wing-folding mechanisms. the "carrier stuka" was to be built at the weserflug company's lemwerder plant between april and july 1940.[53]among the "special" equipment of the ju 87 c was a two-seat rubber dinghy with signal ammunition and emergency ammunition. a quick fuel dump mechanism and two inflatable 750 l (200 us gal) bags in each wing and a further two 500 l (130 us gal) bags in the fuselage enabled the ju 87 c to remain afloat for up to three days in calm seas.[53]on 6 october 1939, with the war already underway, 120 of the planned ju 87 tr(c)s on order at that point were cancelled. despite the cancellation, the tests continued using catapults. the ju 87 c had a takeoff weight of 5,300 kg (11,700 lb) and a speed of 133 km/h (83 mph) on departure. the ju 87 could be launched with a sc 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb and four sc 50 kg (110 lb) bombs under the fuselage. the c-1 was to have two mg 17s mounted in the wing with a mg 15 operated by the rear gunner. on 18 may 1940, production of the c-1 was switched to the r-1.[54]known prototypes[50]ju 87 v10: registration d-ihfh (changed to stammkennzeichen of tk+hd). w.nr 4928. first flown 17 march 1938ju 87 v11: stammkennzeichen of tv+ov. w.nr 4929. first flown 12 may 1938ju 87d[edit]despite the stuka's vulnerability to enemy fighters having been exposed during the battle of britain, the luftwaffe had no choice but to continue its development, as there was no replacement aircraft in sight.[55] the result was the d-series. in june 1941, the rlm ordered five prototypes, the ju 87 v21–25. a daimler-benz db 603 powerplant was to be installed in the ju 87 d-1, but it did not have the power of the jumo 211 and performed "poorly" during tests and was dropped.[56] the ju 87 d-series featured two coolant radiators underneath the inboard sections of the wings, while the oil cooler was relocated to the position formerly occupied by the single, undernose "chin" coolant radiator. the d-series also introduced an aerodynamically refined cockpit with better visibility and space.[57] armour protection was increased and a new dual-barrel 7.92 mm (.312 in) mg 81z machine gun with an extremely high rate of fire was installed in the rear defensive position. engine power was increased again, the jumo 211j now delivering 1,420 ps (1,044 kw or 1,400 hp).[57]bomb carrying ability was nearly quadrupled from 500 kg (1,100 lb) in the b-version to 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) in the d-version (max. load for short ranges, overload condition), a typical bomb load ranged from 500–1,200 kg (1,100–2,600 lb).[58] kette of ju 87 ds in flight, october/november 1943the internal fuel capacity of the ju 87d was raised to 800 l (of which 780 l were usable) by adding wing tanks while retaining the option to carry two 300 l drop tanks.[59] tests at rechlin-lärz airfield revealed it made possible a flight duration of 2 hours and 15 minutes. with an extra two 300 l (80 us gal) fuel tanks, it could achieve four hours flight time.[57]the d-2 was a variant used as a glider tug by converting older d-series airframes. it was intended as the tropical version of the d-1 and had heavier armour to protect the crew from ground fire. the armour reduced its performance and caused the oberkommando der luftwaffe to "place no particular value on the production of the d-2".[57]the d-3 was an improved d-1 with more armour for its ground-attack role. some ju 87 d-3s were designated d-3n or d-3 trop and fitted with night or tropical equipment.[57] the d-4 designation applied to a prototype torpedo-bomber version, which could carry a 750–905 kg (1,653–1,995 lb) aerial torpedo on a pvc 1006 b rack—this setup would have had the capacity to carry the luftorpedo lt 850, the german version of the well-proven japanese type 91 aerial torpedo of 848 kg (1,870 lb). the d-4 was to be converted from d-3 airframes and, in place of the carrier-specific ju 87c series designs, operated from the aircraft carrier graf zeppelin.[60] other modifications included a flame eliminator and, unlike earlier d variants, two 20 mm mg 151/20 cannon, while the radio operator/rear gunner's ammunition supply was increased by 1,000 to 2,000 rounds.[61]the ju 87 d-5 was based on the d-3 design and was unique in the ju 87 series as it had wings 0.6 metres (2-feet) longer than previous variants. the two 7.92 mm mg 17 wing guns were exchanged for more powerful 20 mm mg 151/20s to better suit the aircraft's ground-attack role. the window in the floor of the cockpit was reinforced and four, rather than the previous three, aileron hinges were installed. higher diving speeds were obtained of 650 km/h (400 mph) up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft). the range was recorded as 715 km (444 mi) at ground level and 835 km (519 mi) at 5,000 m (16,000 ft).[58]the d-6, according to "operating instructions, works document 2097", was built in limited numbers to train pilots on "rationalised versions". due to shortages in raw materials, it did not go into mass production.[62]the d-7 was another ground attack aircraft based on d-1 airframes upgraded to d-5 standard (armour, wing cannons, extended wing panels), while the d-8 was similar to the d-7 but based on d-3 airframes.[62] the d-7 and d-8 were both were fitted with flame dampers, and could conduct night operations.[62]production of the d-1 variant started in 1941 with 495 ordered. these aircraft were delivered between may 1941 and march 1942. the rlm wanted 832 machines produced from february 1941. the weserflug company was tasked with their production. from june to september 1941, 40 ju 87 ds were expected to be built, increasing to 90 thereafter.[63] various production problems were encountered. one of the planned 48 was produced in july. of the 25 the rlm hoped for in august 1941, none were delivered.[63] in september did the first two of the planned 102 ju 87s came off the production lines.[64] the shortfalls continued to the end of 1941. during this time, the wfg plant in lemwerder moved production to berlin. over 165 ju 87s had not been delivered and production was only 23 ju 87 ds per month out of the 40 expected. by the spring of 1942 to the end of production in 1944, 3,300 ju 87s, mostly d-1s, d-2s and d-5s had been manufactured.[64]in january 1943, a variety of ju 87 ds became "test beds" for the ju 87 g variants. at the start of 1943, the coastal luftwaffe erprobungsstelle test centre at tarnewitz tested this combination from a static position. oberst g. wolfgang vorwald noted the experiments were not successful, and suggested the cannon be installed on the messerschmitt me 410.[65] testing continued, and on 31 january 1943, ju 87 d-1 w.nr 2552 was tested by hauptmann hans-karl stepp near the briansk training area. stepp noted the increase in drag, which reduced the aircraft's speed to 259 km/h (161 mph). stepp also noted that the aircraft was also less agile than the existing d variants. d-1 and d-3 variants operated in combat with the 37 mm (1.5 in) bk 37 cannon in 1943.[65]known prototypesju 87 v 21. registration d-inrf. w.nr 0870536.

3.7 cm (1.46 in) underwing gun pods.with the g variant, the ageing airframe of the ju 87 found new life as an anti-tank aircraft. this was the final operational version of the stuka, and was deployed on the eastern front.the reverse in german military fortunes after 1943 and the appearance of huge numbers of well-armoured soviet tanks caused junkers to adapt the existing design to combat this new threat. the henschel hs 129b had proved a potent ground attack weapon, but its large fuel tanks made it vulnerable to enemy fire, prompting the rlm to say "that in the shortest possible time a replacement of the hs 129 type must take place."[66] with soviet tanks the priority targets, the development of a further variant as a successor to the ju 87d began in november 1942. on 3 november, erhard milch raised the question of replacing the ju 87, or redesigning it altogether. it was decided to keep the design as it was, but the power-plant was upgraded to a junkers jumo 211j, and two 30 mm (1.2 in) cannons were added. the variant was also designed to carry a 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) free-fall bomb load. furthermore, the armoured protection of the ilyushin il-2 sturmovik—a feature pioneered by the 1916–17 origin junkers j.i all-metal sesquiplane of world war i imperial germany's luftstreitkräfte—was copied to protect the crew from ground fire now that the ju 87 would be required to conduct low level attacks.[67]hans-ulrich rudel, a stuka ace, had suggested using two 37 mm (1.46 in) flak 18 guns, each one in a self-contained under-wing gun pod, as the bordkanone bk 3,7, after achieving success against soviet tanks with the 20 mm mg 151/20 cannon. these gun pods were fitted to a ju 87 d-1, w.nr 2552. the first flight of the machine took place on 31 january 1943, piloted by hauptmann hans-karl stepp.[65] the continuing problems with about two dozen of the ju 88p-1, and slow development of the henschel hs 129b-3, each of them equipped with a large, pak 40-based, autoloading bordkanone 7,5 7.5 cm (2.95 in) cannon in a conformal gun pod beneath the fuselage, meant the ju 87g was put into production. in april 1943, the first production ju 87 g-1s were delivered to front line units.[65] the two 37 mm (1.46 in) bordkanone bk 3,7 cannons were mounted in under-wing gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition. with these weapons, the kanonenvogel ("cannon-bird"), as it was nicknamed, proved very successful in the hands of stuka aces such as rudel. the g-1 was converted from older d-series airframes, retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. the g-2 was similar to the g-1 except for use of the extended wing of the d-5. 208 g-2s were built and at least a further 22 more were converted from d-3 airframes.[68]only a handful of production gs were committed in the battle of kursk. on the opening day of the offensive, hans-ulrich rudel flew the only "official" ju 87 g, although a significant number of ju 87d variants were fitted with the 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon, and operated as unofficial ju 87 gs before the battle. in june 1943, the rlm ordered 20 ju 87gs as production variants.[69] the g-1 later influenced the design of the fairchild republic a-10 thunderbolt ii, with hans rudel's book, stuka pilot being required reading for all members of the a-x project.[70]night-harassment variants[edit]the soviet air force practice of harassing german ground forces using antiquated polikarpov po-2 and r-5 biplanes at night to drop flares and fragmentation bombs, inspired the luftwaffe to form its own störkampfstaffeln (harassment squadrons). on 23 july 1942, junkers offered the ju 87 b-2, r-2 and r-4s with flammenvernichter ("flame eliminators"). on 10 november 1943, the rlm gl/c-e2 division finally authorised the design in directive no. 1117.[71] this new equipment made the ju 87 more difficult to detect from the ground in darkness.pilots were also asked to complete the new "blind flying certificate 3", which was especially introduced for this new type of operation. pilots were trained at night, over unfamiliar terrain, and forced to rely on their instruments for direction. the ju 87's standard revi c12d gunsight was replaced with the new nachtrevi ("nightrevi") c12n. on some ju 87s, the revi 16d was exchanged for the nachtrevi 16d. to help the pilot see his instrument panel, a violet light was installed.[72]on 15 november 1942, the auxiliary staffel were created. by mid-1943, luftflotte 1 was given four staffeln while luftflotte 4 and luftwaffe kommando ost (luftwaffe command east) were given six and two respectively. in the first half of 1943, 12 nachtschlachtgruppen ("night battle groups") had been formed, flying a multitude of different types of aircraft, including the ju 87, which proved itself ideally suited to the low-level slow flying needed.[73]production[edit]despite teething problems with the ju 87, the rlm ordered 216 ju 87 a-1s into production and wanted to receive delivery of all machines between january 1936 and 1938. the junkers production capacity was fully occupied and licensing to other production facilities became necessary. the first 35 ju 87 a-1s were therefore produced by the weser flugzeugbau (wfg). by 1 september 1939, 360 ju 87 as and bs had been built by the junkers factories at dessau and weserflug factory in lemwerder near bremen. by 30 september 1939, junkers had received 2,365,196 reichsmark (rm) for ju 87 construction orders. the rlm paid another 243,646 rm for development orders. according to audit records in berlin, by the end of the financial year on 30 september 1941, 3,059,000 rm had been spent on ju 87 airframes.[74] by 30 june 1940, 697 ju 87 b-1s and 129 b-2s alone had been produced. another 105 r-1s and seven r-2s had been built.[74] a ju 87d during wing installationthe range of the b-2 was not sufficient, and it was dropped in favour of the ju 87 r long-range versions in the second half of 1940. the 105 r-1s were converted to r-2 status and a further 616 production r-2s were ordered. in may 1941, the development of the d-1 was planned and was ordered into production by march 1942. the expansion of the junkers ju 88 production lines to compensate for the withdrawal of dornier do 17 production delayed production of the ju 87 d. the weserflug plant in lemwerder experienced production shortfalls. this prompted erhard milch to visit and threaten the company into meeting the rlm's ju 87 d-1 requirements on 23 february 1942.[75] to meet these demands, 700 skilled workers were needed.[75] skilled workers had been called up for military service in the wehrmacht. junkers were able to supply 300 german workers to the weserflug factory, and as an interim solution, soviet prisoners of war and soviet civilians deported to germany.[75] working around the clock, the shortfall was made good. wfg received an official commendation.[75] by may 1942, demand increased further. chief of procurement general walter herthel found that each unit needed 100 ju 87s as standard strength and an average of 20 per month to cover attrition. not until june–december 1942 did production capacity increase, and 80 ju 87s were produced per month.[75]by 17 august 1942, production had climbed rapidly after blohm & voss bv 138 production was scaled down and licence work had shut down at wfg. production now reached 150 ju 87 d airframes per month, but spare parts were failing to reach the same production levels. undercarriage parts were in particularly short supply. milch ordered production to 350 ju 87s per month in september 1942. this was not achievable due to the insufficient production capacity in the reich.[75]the rlm considered setting up production facilities in slovakia. but this would delay production until the buildings and factories could be furnished with the machine tools. these tools were also in short supply, and the rlm hoped to purchase them from switzerland and italy. the slovaks could provide 3,500–4,000 workers, but no technical personnel.[76] the move would only produce another 25 machines per month at a time when demand was increasing. in october, production plans were dealt another blow when one of wfgs plants burned down, leaving a chronic shortage of tailwheels and undercarriage parts. junkers director and member of the luftwaffe industry council carl frytag reported that by january 1943 only 120 ju 87s could be produced at bremen and 230 at berlin-tempelhof.[76]decline and end of production[edit]after evaluating ju 87 operations on the eastern front, hermann göring ordered production limited to 200 per month in total. general der schlachtflieger ("general of close-support aviation") ernst kupfer decided continued development would "hardly bring any further tactical value". adolf galland, a fighter pilot with operational and combat experience in strike aircraft, said that abandoning development would be premature, but 150 machines per month would be sufficient.[76] two junkers ju 87 ds near completionon 28 july 1943, strike and bomber production was to be scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given priority. on 3 august 1943, milch contradicted this and declared that this increase in fighter production would not affect production of the ju 87, ju 188, ju 288 and ju 290. this was an important consideration as the life expectancy of a ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours.[77] on 26 october, general der schlachtflieger ernst kupfer reported the ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the focke-wulf fw 190f should take its place. milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of ju 87 d-3 and d-5 production for a smooth transition period.[77]in may 1944, production wound down. 78 ju 87s were built in may and 69 rebuilt from damaged machines. in the next six months, 438 ju 87 ds and gs were added to the ju 87 force as new or repaired aircraft. it is unknown whether any ju 87s were built from parts unofficially after december 1944 and the end of production.[77]overall, 550 ju 87 as and b2s were completed at the junkers factory in dessau. production of the ju 87 r and d variants was transferred to the weserflug company, which produced 5,930 of the 6,500 ju 87s produced in total.[78] during the course of the war, little damage was done to the wfg plant at lemwerder. attacks throughout 1940-45 caused little lasting damage and succeeded only in damaging some ju 87 airframes, in contrast to the focke-wulf plant in bremen.[79] at berlin-tempelhof, little delay or damage was caused to ju 87 production, despite the heavy bombings and large-scale destruction inflicted on other targets. the wfg again went unscathed. the junkers factory at dessau was heavily attacked, but not until ju 87 production had ceased. the ju 87 repair facility at the wels aircraft works was destroyed on 30 may 1944, and the site abandoned ju 87 links.[80]operational history[edit]spanish civil war[edit] condor legion's junkers ju 87a with spanish rebel markings.among the many german aircraft designs that participated in the condor legion, and as part of other german involvement in the spanish civil war, a single ju 87 a-0 (the v4 prototype) was allocated serial number 29-1 and was assigned to the vj/88, the experimental staffel of the legion's fighter wing. the aircraft was secretly loaded onto the ship usaramo and departed hamburg harbor on the night of 1 august 1936, arriving in cádiz five days later. the only known information pertaining to its combat career in spain is that it was piloted by unteroffizier herman beuer, and took part in the nationalist offensive against bilbao in 1937. presumably the aircraft was then secretly returned to germany.[81]in january 1938, three ju 87 as from the legion condor arrived. several problems became evident—the spatted undercarriage sank into muddy airfield surfaces, and the spats were temporarily removed. the maximum 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb load could only be carried if the gunner vacated his seat, therefore the bomb load was restricted to 250 kg (550 lb). these aircraft supported the nationalist forces and carried out anti-shipping missions until they returned to germany in october 1938.[81] it only became known in the early 21st century that these 3 bombers were stationed on the airfield in la sénia (tarragona), and were sent on a mission to bomb the centres of four villages, benassal, albocàsser, ares del maestre and vilar de canes in castellón in may 1938, killing 38 civilians. a few days later several german soldiers came to the villages to photograph and study the results of the bombardment. there was no battle going on in the region and it appears that the only purpose of the mission was to test the airplanes. it was claimed that the rebel forces of franco knew nothing of it and that it was ordered directly by the luftwaffe.[82]during the catalonia offensive in january 1939, the junkers ju 87 returned to spain. on the morning of 21 january 1939, 34 heinkel he 111, along with some escorts and three ju 87b, attacked the port of barcelona, five days before the city was captured by the fascists.[83] 29 republican fighters were defending the city. there were more than 100 aircraft operating over the city and, while a ju 87 was dive-bombing a ship, a republican polikarpov i-15 pilot, francisco alférez jiménez, claimed it destroyed near el vendrell, in coma-ruga, but the stuka was capable of landing on the beach without crashing. that was the only time a stuka attacked the capital of catalonia.[84] on 24 january 1939, a group of stukas prevented the destruction of a bridge near barcelona by strafing the demolition engineers on molins de rei. during the attack the republican ground defenders, equipped with a quadruple pm m1910 mounting, hit one pilot (heinz bohne) in both legs and the stuka crashed, seriously injuring bohne, and his machine gunner, albert conrad. those two were the only stuka casualties of the war.[85]as with the ju 87 a-0, the b-1s were returned discreetly to the reich.[86] the experience of the spanish civil war proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. the ju 87 had however not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the stuka crews.[87]second world war[edit]all stuka units were moved to germany's eastern border in preparation for the invasion of poland. on the morning of 15 august 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the luftwaffe at neuhammer training grounds near sagan, 13 ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. the planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time to pull out of the dive.[88]poland[edit] ju 87 bs over poland, september/october 1939on 1 september 1939, the wehrmacht invaded poland, triggering world war ii.generalquartiermeister der luftwaffe records indicate a total force of 366 ju 87 a and bs were available for operations on 31 august 1939.[25] the first ju 87 operation was to destroy polish demolition charges fixed to the rail bridges over the vistula, that linked eastern germany to the danzig corridor and east prussia as well as polish pomerania. to do this, ju 87s were ordered to perform a low-level attack on the polish army garrison headquarters. ii. and iii./stg 1 targeted the cables along the embankment, the electricity plant and signal boxes at dirschau (now tczew, poland. at exactly 04:26 cet, a kette ("chain" or flight of three) of ju 87s of 3./stg 1 led by staffelkapitän oberleutnant bruno dilly carried out the first bombing attack of the war. the stukas attacked 11 minutes before the official german declaration of hostilities and hit the targets. the ju 87s achieved complete success. the mission failed as the german army delayed their advance allowing the poles to carry out repairs and destroy all but one of the bridges before the germans could reach them.[44][89][90]a ju 87 achieved the first air victory during world war ii on the morning of 1 september 1939, when rottenführer leutnant frank neubert of i./stg 2 "immelmann" shot down a polish pzl p.11c fighter while it was taking off from balice airfield; its pilot, captain mieczysław medwecki, was killed. in air-to-air combat, ju 87 formations were well protected by german fighter aircraft and losses were light against the tenacious, but short lived opposition.[91]the ju 87s reverted to ground attack missions for the campaign after the opening air attacks. ju 87s were involved in the controversial but effective attacks at wieluń. the lack of anti-aircraft artillery in the polish army magnified the impact of the ju 87. at piotrków trybunalski i./stg 76 and i./stg 2 destroyed a polish infantry division de-training there. troop trains were also easy targets. stg 77 destroyed one such target at radomsko.[92] during the battle of radom six polish divisions trapped by encircling german forces were forced to surrender after a relentless four-day bombardment by stg 51, 76 and 77. employed in this assault were 50 kg (110 lb) fragmentation bombs, which caused appalling casualties to the polish ground troops. demoralised, the poles surrendered. the stukas also participated in the battle of bzura which resulted in the breaking of polish resistance. the dive bomber wings (sturzkampfgeschwader) alone dropped 388 tonnes (428 tons) of bombs during this battle.[93] during the siege of warsaw and the battle of modlin, the ju 87 wings contributed to the defeat of well-entrenched and resolute polish forces. iv(stuka)./lg 1 was particularly effective in destroying the fortified modlin.[94]the luftwaffe had a few anti-shipping naval units such as 4.(st)/trgr 186 to deal with polish naval forces. this unit performed effectively, sinking the 1540-ton destroyer wicher and the minelayer gryf of the polish navy (both moored in a harbour).[91] the torpedo boat mazur (412 tons) was sunk at oksywie; the gunboat general haller (441 tons) was sunk in hel harbour on 6 september—during the battle of hel—along with the minesweeper mewa (183 tons) and its sister ships czapla and jaskolka with several auxiliaries. the polish naval units trapped in the baltic were destroyed by ju 87 operations.[95]once again, enemy air opposition was light, and the stukawaffe (stuka force) lost 31 aircraft during the campaign.[96]norway[edit]operation weserübung began on 9 april 1940 with the invasions of norway and denmark. denmark capitulated within the day; norway continued to resist with british and french help. the campaign was not a blitzkrieg of fast-moving armoured divisions supported by air power as the mountainous terrain ruled out close panzer/stuka cooperation. instead, the germans relied on paratroops transported by junkers ju 52s and specialised ski troops. the ju 87s were given the role of ground attack and anti-shipping missions; they proved to be the most effective weapon in the luftwaffe's armoury carrying out the latter task.[96] erhard milch addressing a ju 87 staffel on a norwegian airfieldon 9 april, the first stukas took off at 10:59 from occupied airfields to destroy oscarsborg fortress, after the loss of the german cruiser blücher, which disrupted the amphibious landings in oslo through oslofjord. the 22 ju 87s had helped suppress the norwegian defenders during the ensuing battle of drøbak sound, but the defenders did not surrender until after oslo had been captured. as a result, the german naval operation failed.[97] stg 1 caught the 735 ton norwegian destroyer æger off stavanger and hit her in the engine room. æger was run aground and scuttled.[98] the stuka wings were now equipped with the new ju 87 r, which differed from the ju 87 b by having increased internal fuel capacity and two 300l underwing drop tanks for more range.[96]the stukas had numerous successes against allied naval vessels and in particular the royal navy which posed a formidable threat to german naval and coastal operations. the heavy cruiser suffolk was attacked on 17 april. her stern was virtually destroyed but she limped back to scapa flow with 33 dead and 38 wounded crewmen. the light cruiser squadron consisting of the sister ships curacoa and curlew were subjected to lengthy attacks which badly damaged the former for one ju 87 lost. a witness later said, "they threatened to take our masthead with them in every screaming nerve-racking dive".[99] the same fate nearly befell the sloop black swan. on 27 april, a bomb passed through the quarterdeck, a wardroom, a water tank and 4-inch (10.2 cm) magazine and out through the hull to explode in the fjord. the muffled explosion limited the damage to her hull. black swan fired 1,000 rounds, but failed to shoot any of her attackers down. hms bittern was sunk on 30 april. the french large destroyer bison was sunk along with hms afridi by sturzkampfgeschwader 1 on 3 may 1940 during the evacuation from namsos. bison's forward magazine was hit, killing 108 of the crew. afridi, which attempted to rescue bison's survivors, was sunk with the loss of 63 sailors.[98] 49 officers and men, 13 soldiers and 33 survivors from bison were lost aboard afridi.[100] all ships were targeted. armed trawlers were used under the german air umbrella in an attempt to make smaller targets. such craft were not armoured or armed. the ju 87s demonstrated this on 30 april when they sank the jardine (452 tons) and warwickshire (466 tons). on 15 may, the polish troopship chrobry (11,442 tons) was sunk.[101][102][103]the stukas also had an operational effect, even when little damage was done. on 1 may 1940, vice admiral lionel wells commanded a home fleet expedition of seven destroyers, the heavy cruiser berwick, the aircraft carriers glorious and ark royal, and the battleship valiant. the carriers mounted fighter patrols over the ships evacuating troops from andalsnes. the stuka waves (accompanied by he 111s) achieved several near misses, but were unable to obtain a hit. nevertheless, wells ordered that no ship was to operate within range of the ju 87s' norwegian airfields. the ju 87s had, in effect, driven british sea power from the norwegian coast. moreover, victor reported to the commander-in-chief of the home fleet admiral, charles forbes, that carrier operations were no longer practical under the current conditions.[104]in the following weeks, stg 1 continued their sea operations. off namsos on 5 may 1940, they caught and sank the royal norwegian navy transports aafjord (335 tons) and blaafjeld (1,146 tons). the ju 87s then took to bombing the town and the airstrip to support the german forces under the command of eduard dietl. the town fell in the first week of may. in the remaining four weeks of the campaign in norway, the ju 87s supported german forces in containing the allied land forces in narvik until they withdrew in early june.[100]france and the low countries[edit]the ju 87 units had learned lessons from the polish and norwegian campaigns. the failures of poland and the stukas of i./stg 1 to silence the oscarborg fort, ensured even more attention was paid to pin-point bombing during the phoney war period. this was to pay off in the western campaign.[105]when fall gelb (case yellow) began on 10 may 1940, the stuka helped swiftly neutralise the fortress of eben emael, belgium. the headquarters of the commander responsible for ordering the destruction of the belgian army-held bridges along the albert canal was stationed in the village of lanaken (14 km/ mi to the north). the stuka demonstrated its accuracy when the small building was destroyed by four direct hits. as a result, only one of the three bridges was destroyed, allowing the german army to rapidly advance in the opening days of the battle of belgium.[105] the ju 87 proved to be a useful asset to army group b in the low countries. in pitched battles against french armoured forces at hannut and gembloux ju 87s effectively neutralised artillery and armour.[106]the ju 87s also assisted german forces in the battle of the netherlands. the dutch navy in concert with the british were evacuating the dutch royal family and dutch gold reserves through the country's ports. ju 87s sank the dutch jan van galen (1,316 tons) and johan maurtis van nassau (1,520 tons) as they provided close-shore artillery support at waalhaven and the afsluitdijk. the british valentine was crippled, beached and scuttled while winchester, whitley and westminster were damaged. whitley was later beached and scuttled after an air attack on 19 may.[106]the ju 87 units were also instrumental in the battle of france. it was here that most of the ju 87-equipped units were concentrated. they assisted in the breakthrough at sedan, the critical and first major land battle of the war on french territory. the stukawaffe flew 300 sorties against french positions, with stg 77 alone flying 201 individual missions. the ju 87s benefited from heavy fighter protection from messerschmitt bf 109 units.[107] when resistance was organised, the ju 87s could be vulnerable. for example, on 12 may, near sedan, six french curtiss h-75s from groupe de chasse i/5 (group interception) attacked a formation of ju 87s, claiming 11 out of 12 unescorted ju 87s without loss (the germans recorded six losses over sedan entire).[108][109] for the most part, allied opposition was disorganised. during the battles of montcornet, arras, bolougne and calais the ju 87 operations broke-up counterattacks and offered pin-point aerial artillery support for german infantry.[110]the luftwaffe benefited from excellent ground-to-air communications throughout the campaign. radio equipped forward liaison officers could call upon the stukas and direct them to attack enemy positions along the axis of advance. in some cases the stukas responded in 10–20 minutes. oberstleutnant hans seidemann (richthofen's chief of staff) said that "never again was such a smoothly functioning system for discussing and planning joint operations achieved".[111]during the battle of dunkirk, many allied ships were lost to ju 87 attacks as the british operation dynamo sought to evacuate british and french armies from the pocket. the french destroyer l'adroit was sunk on 21 may 1940, followed by the paddle steamer crested eagle on 28 may. the french channel-steamer côte d'arzur (3,047) followed. the ju 87s operated to maximum effectiveness when the weather allowed. raf fighter units were held back and allied air cover was patchy at best. on 29 may the royal navy destroyer h.m.s.grenade was severely damaged by a ju 87 attack within dunkirk's harbour, and subsequently sank. the french destroyer mistral was crippled by bomb damage the same day. jaguar and verity were badly damaged while the trawlers calvi and polly johnson (363 and 290 tons) disintegrated under bombardment. the merchant ship fenella (2,376 tons) was sunk having taken on 600 soldiers. the attacks brought the evacuation to a halt for a time. the rail ships lorina and normannia (1,564 and 1,567 tons) were sunk also.[112] by 29 may, the allies had lost 31 vessels sunk and 11 damaged.[113] on 1 june the ju 87s sank the skipjack (815 tons) while the destroyer keith was sunk and basilisk was crippled before being scuttled by whitehall. whitehall was later badly damaged and along with ivanhoe, staggered back to dover. havant, commissioned for just three weeks, was sunk and in the evening the french destroyer foudroyant sank after a mass-attack. further victories against shipping were claimed before nightfall on 1 june. the steamer pavon was lost while carrying 1,500 dutch soldiers most of whom were killed. the oil tanker niger was also destroyed. a flotilla of french minesweepers were also lost—denis papin (264 tons), the le moussaillon (380 tons) and venus (264 tons).[114]in total, 89 merchantmen (of 126,518 grt) were lost, and the royal navy lost 29 of its 40 destroyers used in the battle (8 sunk, 23 damaged and out of service).[115] the campaign ended after the french surrender on 25 june 1940. allied air power had been ineffective and disorganised, and as a result, stuka losses were mainly due to ground fire. 120 machines, one-third of the stuka force, were destroyed or damaged by all causes from 10 may to 25 june 1940.[116]battle of britain[edit]for the battle of britain, the luftwaffe's order of battle included bomber wings equipped with the ju 87. lehrgeschwader 2's iv.(st), sturzkampfgeschwader 1's iii. gruppe and sturzkampfgeschwader 2's iii. gruppe, sturzkampfgeschwader 51 and sturzkampfgeschwader 3's i. gruppe were committed to the battle. as an anti-shipping weapon, the ju 87 proved a potent weapon in the early stages of the battle. on 4 july 1940, stg 2 made a successful attack on a convoy in the english channel, sinking four freighters: britsum, dallas city, deucalion and kolga. six more were damaged. that afternoon, 33 ju 87s delivered the single most deadly air assault on british territory in history, when 33 ju 87s of iii./stg 51, avoiding royal air force (raf) interception, sank the 5,500 ton anti-aircraft ship hms foylebank in portland harbour, killing 176 of its 298 crew. one of foylebank's gunners, leading seaman john f. mantle continued to fire on the stukas as the ship sank. he was awarded a posthumous victoria cross for remaining at his post despite being mortally wounded. mantle may have been responsible for the single ju 87 lost during the raid.[117][118]during august, the ju 87s also had some success. on 13 august the opening of the main german attacks on airfields took place; it was known to the luftwaffe as adlertag ("eagle day"). messerschmitt bf 109s of jagdgeschwader 26 (jg 26) were sent out in advance of the main strike and successfully drew off raf fighters, allowing 86 ju 87s of stg 1 to attack raf detling in kent unhindered. the attack killed the station commander, destroyed 20 raf aircraft on the ground and a great many of the airfield's buildings. detling was not an raf fighter command station.[119]the battle of britain proved for the first time that the junkers ju 87 was vulnerable in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. the ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. the stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over britain. it was withdrawn from attacks on britain in august after prohibitive losses, leaving the luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.[120]steady losses had occurred throughout their participation in the battle. on 18 august, known as the hardest day because both sides suffered heavy losses, the stuka was withdrawn after 16 were destroyed and many others damaged.[121] according to the generalquartiermeister der luftwaffe, 59 stukas had been destroyed and 33 damaged to varying degrees in six weeks of operations. over 20% of the total stuka strength had been lost between 8 and 18 august;[122] and the myth of the stuka shattered.[122][123] the ju 87s did succeed in sinking six warships, 14 merchant ships, badly damaging seven airfields and three chain home radar stations, and destroying 49 british aircraft, mainly on the ground.[124]on 19 august, the units of viii. fliegerkorps moved up from their bases around cherbourg-octeville and concentrated in the pas de calais under luftflotte 2, closer to the area of the proposed invasion of britain.[124] on 13 september, the luftwaffe targeted airfields again, with a small number of ju 87s crossing the coast at selsey and heading for tangmere.[125] after a lull, anti-shipping operations attacks were resumed by some ju 87 units from 1 november 1940, as part of the new winter tactic of enforcing a blockade. over the next 10 days, seven merchant ships were sunk or damaged, mainly in the thames estuary, for the loss of four ju 87s. on 14 november 19 stukas from iii./st.g 1 with escort drawn from jg 26 and jg 51 went out against another convoy; as no targets were found over the estuary, the stukas proceeded to attack dover, their alternate target.[124]bad weather resulted in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the ju 87 groups began re-deploying to poland, as part of the concealed build-up for operation barbarossa. by spring 1941, only st.g 1 with 30 ju 87s remained facing the united kingdom. operations on a small scale continued throughout the winter months into march. targets included ships at sea, the thames estuary, the chatham naval dockyard and dover and night-bomber sorties made over the channel. these attacks were resumed the following winter.[124][126]north africa and the mediterranean[edit] a ju 87 b of 5/stg 2 is examined by british troops after making an emergency landing in the north african desert, december 1941.in response to the italian defeats in greece and north africa, the oberkommando der wehrmacht ordered the deployment of german forces to these theatres. amongst the luftwaffe contingent deployed was the command unit stg 3, which touched down in sicily in december 1940. in the next few days, two groups - 80 stukas - were deployed under x. fliegerkorps.the first task of the korps was to attack british shipping passing between sicily and africa, in particular the convoys aimed at re-supplying malta. the ju 87s first made their presence felt by subjecting the british aircraft carrier hms illustrious to heavy attack. the crews were confident that they could sink it as the flight deck had an area of about 6,500 square metres.[127] on 10 january 1941, the stuka crews were told that four direct hits with 500 kg (1,100 lb) bombs would be enough to sink the carrier. the ju 87s delivered six and three damaging near-misses but the ship's engines were untouched and she made for the besieged harbour of malta.[128]the italian regia aeronautica was equipped for a while with the stukas.[129] in 1939, the italian government asked the rlm to supply 100 ju 87s. italian pilots were sent to graz in austria to be trained for dive-bombing aircraft. in the spring of 1940, between 72 and 108 ju 87 b-1s, some of them ex-luftwaffe aircraft, were delivered to 96° gruppo bombardamento a tuffo. the italian stuka, renamed picchiatello, was in turn assigned to gruppi 97°, 101° and 102°. the picchiatelli were used against malta, allied convoys in mediterranean and in north africa (where they took part in conquering tobruk). they were used by the regia aeronautica up to 1942.[129]some of the picchiatelli saw action in the opening phase of the italian invasion of greece in october 1940. their numbers were low and ineffective in comparison to german operations. the italian forces were quickly pushed back. by early 1941, the greeks had pushed into italian occupied albania. once again, hitler decided to send military aid to his ally.[130] before the luftwaffe could intervene, the italian ju 87s achieved some successes. 97 gruppo (group) and its 239 squadriglia (squadron) sinking the hellenic navy freighter susanah off corfu on 4 april 1941 while the torpedo boat proussa was sunk later in the day. on 21 april the greek freighter ioanna was sunk and they accounted for the british tanker hekla off tobruk on 25 may and then the royal australian navy destroyer waterhen on 20 june. the british gunboat cricket and supply submarine cachalot became victims. the former was crippled and later sunk by italian warships.[131]in march, the pro-german yugoslav government was toppled. a furious hitler ordered the attack to be expanded to include yugoslavia. operation marita commenced on 7 april. the luftwaffe committed stg 1, 2 and 77 to the campaign.[132] the stuka once again spearheaded the air assault, with a front line strength of 300 machines, against minimal yugoslav resistance in the air, allowing the stukas to develop a fearsome reputation in this region. operating unmolested, they took a heavy toll of ground forces, suffering only light losses to ground fire. the effectiveness of the dive bombers helped bring about yugoslav capitulation in ten days. the stukas also took a peripheral part in operation punishment, hitler's retribution bombing of belgrade. the dive bombers were to attack airfields and anti-aircraft gun positions as the level bombers struck civilian targets. belgrade was badly damaged, with 2,271 people killed and 12,000 injured.[133]in greece, despite british aid, little air opposition was encountered. as the allies withdrew and resistance collapsed, the allies began evacuating to crete. the stukas inflicted severe damage on allied shipping. on 22 april, the 1,389 ton destroyers psara and ydra were sunk. in the next two days, the greek naval base at piraeus lost 23 vessels to stuka attack.[134]during the battle of crete, the ju 87s also played a significant role. on 21–22 may 1941, the germans attempted to send in reinforcements to crete by sea but lost 10 vessels to "force d" under the command of rear admiral irvine glennie. the force, consisting of the cruisers hms dido, orion and ajax, forced the remaining german ships to retreat. the stukas were called upon to deal with the british naval threat.[135] on 21 may, the destroyer hms juno was sunk and the next day the battleship hms warspite was damaged and the cruiser hms gloucester was sunk, with the loss of 45 officers and 648 ratings. the ju 87s also crippled the cruiser hms fiji that morning, (she was later finished off by bf 109 fighter bombers) while sinking the destroyer hms greyhound with one hit.[136] as the battle of crete drew to a close, the allies began yet another withdrawal. on 23 may, the royal navy lost the destroyers hms kashmir and kelly, followed by hms hereward on 26 may; orion and dido were also severely damaged.[137] orion had been evacuating 1,100 soldiers to north africa; 260 of them were killed and another 280 wounded.[138]the dive bomber wing supported generalfeldmarschall erwin rommel's afrika korps in its two-year campaign in north africa; its other main task was attacking allied shipping.[139] in 1941, ju 87 operations in north africa were dominated by the siege of tobruk, which lasted for over seven months.[140] it served during the battle of gazala and the first battle of el alamein, as well as the decisive second battle of el alamein, which drove rommel back to tunisia. as the tide turned and allied air power grew in the autumn of 1942, the ju 87 became very vulnerable and losses were heavy. the entry of the americans into north africa during operation torch made the situation far worse; the stuka was obsolete in what was now a fighter-bomber's war. the bf 109 and fw 190 could at least fight enemy fighters on equal terms after dropping their ordnance but the stuka could not. the ju 87's vulnerability was demonstrated on 11 november 1942, when 15 ju 87 ds were shot down by united states army air forces (usaaf) curtiss p-40fs in minutes.[141]by 1943, the allies enjoyed air supremacy in north africa. the ju 87s ventured out in rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs at the first sight of enemy aircraft.[142] adding to this trouble, the german fighters had only enough fuel to cover the ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. after that, the stukas were on their own.[143]the dive bombers continued operations in southern europe; after the italian surrender in september 1943, the ju 87 participated in the last campaign-sized victory over the western allies, the dodecanese campaign. the dodecanese islands had been occupied by the british; the luftwaffe committed 75 stukas of stg 3 based in megara (i./stg 3) and argos (ii.stg 3; from 17 october on rhodes), to recover the islands. with the raf bases 500 kilometres (310 mi) away, the ju 87 helped the german landing forces rapidly conquer the islands.[144] on 5 october the minelayer lagnano was sunk along with a patrol vessel, a steam ship and a light tank carrier porto di roma. on 24 october ju 87s sank the landing craft lct115 and cargo ship taganrog at samos. on 31 october the light cruiser aurora was put out of action for a year. the light cruisers penelope and carlisle were badly damaged by stg 3 and the destroyer panther was also sunk by ju 87s before the capitulation of the allied force. it proved to be the stuka's final victory against the british.[145]eastern front[edit]barbarossa; 1941[edit] the eastern front brought new challenges. a ju 87 b-2 is fitted with ski undercarriage to cope with the winter weather, 22 december 1941.on 22 june 1941, the wehrmacht commenced operation barbarossa, the invasion of the soviet union. the luftwaffe order of battle of 22 june 1941 contained four dive bomber wings. viii. fliegerkorps under the command of general der flieger wolfram von richthofen was equipped with units stab, ii. and iii./stg 1. also included were stab, i., ii. and iii. of sturzkampfgeschwader 2 immelmann. attached to ii. fliegerkorps, under the command of general der flieger bruno loerzer, were stab, i., ii. and iii. of stg 77. luftflotte 5, under the command of generaloberst hans-jürgen stumpff, operating from norway's arctic circle, were allotted iv. gruppe (st)/lehrgeschwader 1 (lg 1).[146]the first stuka loss on the soviet-german front occurred early at 03:40–03:47 in the morning of the 22 june. while being escorted by bf 109s from jg 51 to attack brest fortress, oberleutnant karl führing of stg 77 was shot down by an i-153.[147] the dive bomber wing suffered only two losses on the opening day of barbarossa. as a result of the luftwaffe's attention, the soviet air force in the western soviet union was nearly destroyed. the official report claimed 1,489 soviet aircraft destroyed. göring ordered this checked. after picking their way through the wreckage across the front, luftwaffe officers found that the tally exceeded 2,000.[148] in the next two days, the soviets reported the loss of another 1,922 aircraft.[149] soviet aerial resistance continued but ceased to be effective and the luftwaffe maintained air superiority until the end of the year.the ju 87 took a huge toll on soviet ground forces, helping to break up counterattacks of soviet armour, eliminating strongpoints and disrupting the enemy supply lines. a demonstration of the stuka's effectiveness occurred on 5 july, when stg 77 knocked out 18 trains and 500 vehicles.[150] as the 1st and 2nd panzer groups forced bridgeheads across the dnieper river and closed in on kiev, the ju 87s again rendered invaluable support. on 13 september, stukas from stg 1 destroyed the rail network in the vicinity as well as inflicting heavy casualties on escaping red army columns, for the loss of one ju 87.[151] on 23 september, hans-ulrich rudel (who was to become the most decorated serviceman in the wehrmacht) of stg 2, sank the soviet battleship marat, during an air attack on kronstadt harbour near leningrad, with a hit to the bow with a single 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) bomb.[152] during this action, leutnant egbert jaeckel sank the destroyer minsk, while the destroyer steregushchiy and submarine m-74 were also sunk. the stukas also crippled the battleship oktyabrskaya revolutsiya and the destroyers silnyy and grozyashchiy in exchange for two ju 87s shot down.[153]elsewhere on the eastern front, the junkers assisted army group centre in its drive toward moscow. from 13–22 december, 420 vehicles and 23 tanks were destroyed by stg 77, greatly improving the morale of the german infantry, who were by now on the defensive.[154] stg 77 finished the campaign as the most effective dive bomber wing. it had destroyed 2,401 vehicles, 234 tanks, 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 ju 87s to hostile action.[155] at the end of barbarossa, stg 1 had lost 60 stukas in aerial combat and one on the ground. stg 2 lost 39 ju 87s in the air and two on the ground, stg 77 lost 29 of their dive-bombers in the air and three on the ground (25 to enemy action). iv.(st)/lg1, operating from norway, lost 24 ju 87s, all in aerial combat.[156]fall blau to stalingrad; 1942[edit] ju 87b over stalingrad.in early 1942, the ju 87s gave the german army yet more valuable support. on 29 december 1941, the soviet 44th army landed on the kerch peninsula. the luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups (kampfgruppen) and two dive bomber groups belonging to stg 77. with air superiority, the ju 87s operated with impunity. in the first 10 days of the battle of the kerch peninsula, half the landing force was destroyed, while sea lanes were blocked by the stukas inflicting heavy losses on soviet shipping. the ju 87's effectiveness against soviet armour was not yet potent. later versions of the t-34 tank could withstand stuka attack in general, unless a direct hit was scored but the soviet 44th army had only obsolescent types with thin armour which were nearly all destroyed.[157]during the battle of sevastopol, the stukas repeatedly bombed the trapped soviet forces. some ju 87 pilots flew up to 300 sorties against the soviet defenders. luftflotte 4's stg 77 flew 7,708 combat sorties dropping 3,537 tonnes of bombs on the city. their efforts help secure the capitulation of soviet forces on 4 july.[158]for the german summer offensive, fall blau, the luftwaffe had concentrated 1,800 aircraft into luftflotte 4 making it the largest and most powerful air command in the world.[159] the stukawaffe strength stood at 151.[160] during the battle of stalingrad, stukas flew thousands of sorties against soviet positions in the city. stg 1, 2 and 77 flew 320 sorties on 14 october 1942. as the german sixth army pushed the soviets into a 1,000 metre enclave on the west bank of the volga river, 1,208 stuka sorties were flown against this small strip of land. the intense air attack, though causing horrific losses on soviet units, failed to destroy them.[161] the luftwaffe's stuka force made a maximum effort during this phase of the war. they flew an average of 500 sorties per day and caused heavy losses among soviet forces, losing an average of only one stuka per day. the battle of stalingrad marked the high point in the fortunes of the junkers ju 87 stuka. as the strength of the soviet air forces grew, they gradually wrested control of the skies from the luftwaffe. from this point onward, stuka losses increased.[162]kursk and decline; 1943[edit]the stuka was also heavily involved in operation citadel, the battle of kursk. the luftwaffe committed i, ii, iii./st.g 1 and iii./stg 3 under the command of luftflotte 6. i., ii, iii. of stgs 2 and 3 were committed under the command of hans seidemann's fliegerkorps viii.[163] hauptmann rudel's cannon-equipped ju 87 gs had a devastating effect on soviet armour at orel and belgorod. the ju 87s participated in a huge aerial counter-offensive lasting from 16–31 july against a soviet offensive at khotynets and saved two german armies from encirclement, reducing the attacking soviet 11th guards army to 33 tanks by 20 july. the soviet offensive had been completely halted from the air[164] although losses were considerable. fliegerkorps viii lost eight ju 87s on 8 july, six on 9 july, six on 10 july and another eight on 11 july. the stuka arm also lost eight of their knight's cross of the iron cross holders. stg 77 lost 24 ju 87s in the period 5–31 july (stg had lost 23 in july–december 1942), while stg 2 lost another 30 aircraft in the same period. in september 1943, three of the stuka units were re-equipped with the fw 190f and g (ground attack versions) and began to be renamed schlachtgeschwader (attack wings).[165] in the face of overwhelming air opposition, the dive-bomber required heavy protection from german fighters to counter soviet fighters. some units like sg 2 immelmann continued to operate with great success throughout 1943–45, operating the ju 87 g variants equipped with 37 mm cannons, which became tank killers, although in increasingly small numbers.[166] ju 87 d's over the eastern front, december 22, 1943in the wake of the defeat at kursk, ju 87s played a vital defensive role on the southern wing of the eastern front. to combat the luftwaffe, the soviets could deploy 3,000 fighter aircraft. as a result, the stukas suffered heavily. sg 77 lost 30 ju 87s in august 1943 as did sg 2 immelmann, which also reported the loss of 30 aircraft in combat operations.[167] despite these losses, ju 87s helped the xxix army corps break out of an encirclement near the sea of azov.[168] the battle of kiev also included substantial use of the ju 87 units, although again, unsuccessful in stemming the advances. stuka units were with the loss of air superiority, becoming vulnerable on the ground as well. some stuka aces were lost this way.[169] in the aftermath of kursk, stuka strength fell to 184 aircraft in total. this was well below 50 percent of the required strength.[170] on 18 october 1943, stg 1, 2, 3, 5 and 77 were renamed schlachtgeschwader (sg) wings, reflecting their ground-attack role, as these combat wings were now also using ground-attack aircraft, such as the fw 190f-series aircraft. the luftwaffe's dive-bomber units had ceased to exist.[171]a few ju 87s were also retained for anti-shipping operations in the black sea, a role it had proved successful in when operating in the mediterranean. in october 1943, this became evident again when stg 3 carried out several attacks against the soviet black sea fleet. on 6 october 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the leningrad class destroyers kharkov, besposhchadny and sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. after the disaster, josef stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of german aircraft without his personal permission.[172]operation bagration to berlin 1944–45[edit]towards the end of the war, as the allies gained air supremacy, the stuka was being replaced by ground-attack versions of the fw 190.[33] by early 1944, the number of ju 87 units and operational aircraft terminally declined. for the soviet summer offensive, operation bagration, 12 ju 87 groups and five mixed groups (including fw 190s) were on the luftwaffe's order of battle on 26 june 1944.[173] gefechtsverband kuhlmey, a mixed aircraft unit, which included large numbers of stuka dive bombers, was rushed to the finnish front in the summer of 1944 and was instrumental in halting the soviet fourth strategic offensive. the unit claimed 200 soviet tanks and 150 soviet aircraft destroyed for 41 losses.[174] by 31 january 1945, only 104 ju 87s remained operational with their units. the other mixed schlacht units contained a further 70 ju 87s and fw 190s between them. chronic fuel shortages kept the stukas grounded and sorties decreased until the end of the war in may 1945.[175]in the final months of the war the ground attack groups were still able to impose operational constraints upon the enemy. most notably the aircraft participated in the defence of berlin. on 12 january 1945 the 1st belorussian front initiated the vistula–oder offensive. the offensive made rapid progress. the soviets eventually outran their air support which was unable to use forward, quagmire-filled, airfields. the germans, who had fallen back on air bases with good facilities and concrete runways, were able to mount uninterrupted attacks against soviet army columns. reminiscent of the early years, the luftwaffe was able to inflict high losses largely unopposed. over 800 vehicles were destroyed within two weeks. in the first three days of february 1945, 2,000 vehicles and 51 tanks were lost to german air attacks. the belorussian front was forced to abandon its attempt to capture berlin by mid-february 1945. the ju 87 participated in these intense battles in small numbers. it was the largest concentration of german air power since 1940 and even in february 1945 the germans were able to achieve and challenge for air superiority on the eastern front. the air offensive was instrumental in saving berlin, albeit only for three months. the effort exhausted german fuel reserves. the contribution of the ju 87 was exemplified by hans-ulrich rudel, who claimed 13 enemy tanks on 8 february 1945.[176]operators[edit] junkers ju

with "w8" belonging to a me 321 cargo glider unit[178] a later, ground-attack variant, this is displayed at the royal air force museum in london; it was captured by british forces at eggebek, schleswig-holstein in may 1945. it is thought to have been built in 1943–1944 as a d-5 before being rebuilt as a g-2 variant, possibly by fitting g-2 outer wings to a d-5 airframe. the wings have the hard-points for bordkanone bk 3,7 gun-pods, but these are not fitted. it was one of 12 captured german aircraft selected by the british for museum preservation and assigned to the air historical branch. the aircraft was stored and displayed at various raf sites until 1978, when it was moved to the raf museum. in 1967, permission was given to use the aircraft in the film battle of britain and it was repainted and modified to resemble a 1940 variant of the ju 87. the engine was found to be in excellent condition and there was little difficulty in starting it, but returning the aircraft to airworthiness was considered too costly for the filmmakers, and ultimately, models were used in the film to represent stukas. in 1998, the film modifications were removed, and the aircraft returned to the original g-2 configuration.[179]ju 87 r-2/trop. werk nr. 5954 ju 87 r-2/trop 5954 at the museum of science and industry, chicago (2014)this aircraft is displayed in the chicago museum of science

the eaa of wisconsin.[180]one ju87 is under restoration:ju 87 r-4, werk nr. 6234 (incorporating 857509)one aircraft is being restored to airworthy condition from two wrecks, owned by paul allen's flying heritage & combat armor museum[181]. the project takes its identification from ju 87 r-4 werk nr. 6234, which was built in 1941 and served with stukageschwader 5. shot down in april 1942 on a mission to bomb murmansk,[182] it was recovered in 1992. the wreck was purchased by new zealand collector tim wallis, who originally planned for the remains to be restored to airworthy, and later went to the deutsches technikmuseum in berlin. parts from a second airframe, a ju 87 r-2 werknummer 857509 which served bearing the stammkennzeichen of code li+ku from 1./st.g.5, and was recovered to the united kingdom in 1998,[183] have also been incorporated. the project was placed on display in november 2018 and the restoration was stated to take between 18 months and 2 years to complete. work will be conducted in a display hangar so members of the public can see the work underway.other aircraft survive as wreckage recovered from crash sites:the deutsches technikmuseum in berlin has the wreckage of two complete aircraft that were recovered from separate crash sites near murmansk in 1990 and 1994. these wrecks were purchased from new zealand collector tim wallis, who originally planned for the remains to be restored to airworthy, in 1996.[184]the sinsheim auto & technik museum displays the remains of an aircraft that crashed near saint-tropez in 1944 and was raised from the seabed in 1989.[183][185]in october 2006, a ju 87 d-3/trop. was recovered underwater, near rhodes.[186] the aircraft is now in the hellenic air force museumjunkers ju 87 b-2, code 98+01, werk nr. 870406, is on

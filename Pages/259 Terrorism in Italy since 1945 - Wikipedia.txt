terrorism in italy from 1945 to date is a book written by giovanni pellegrino, an italian lawyer and politician. it discusses the political situation in italy from the revival of democracy in 1945 until the present day.
giovanni pellegrino, who for many years was president of the italian parliamentary commission on terrorism and an expert on terrorism in italy, opined that in italy there was a low-intensity civil war, beginning from 1945 to date between the west and eastern europe (between democracy and communism). this 'war' reached its peaked between 1945–1949 - right after world war ii.
with the writer giovanni fasanella he coauthored a book, "la guerra civile" (the civil war) wherein he expressed his opinion on the seeming 60 years long low intensity civil war in italy.[1]
this book x-rays the specific italian situation in contra distinction to other european countries, especially spain and ireland. according to the authors, while these two european countries have similar terror situations, they however differ in their political engagements and precise causes of terrorism different from italy:

spain with the basque ethnic conflict and
ireland with a long  ethnic conflict and religion-political conflict.
the time frame between 1943 till date is spaced over 11 chapters, and is divided into 4 groups, corresponding to 4 time periods.

a lot of documents exists about this period from secret services of italy and nato. reports shows that in these years the communist party had a paramilitary apparatus. this period had less victims and the war was much more a war in being as a war effective.

this step is now well known. was a very dangerous period in italy. more important politicians were killed. the most famous was aldo moro.

fourth time frame (1969–1989) till date[edit]

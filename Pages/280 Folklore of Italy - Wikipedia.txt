[2]


thyrus, the dragon of terni

one of the most famous dragons of italian folklore is thyrus, a river's dragon that besieged terni in the middle ages. one day, a young and brave knight of the noble house of cittadini, tired of witnessing the death of his fellow citizens and depopulation of terni, faced the dragon and killed him. from that day, the town assumed the creature in its coat of arms, accompanied by a latin inscription: "thyrus et amnis dederunt signa teramnis" (english translation: "thyrus and the river gave their insignia to the city of terni") , that stands under the banner of the town of terni, honoring this legend.

[3]


seven headed-dragon

according to a pupular legend, there was a dragon with seven heads who lived near oltre il colle (bergamo province), devouring livestock and drinking of water that would provide immortality, which was at first attacked by rebellious farmers and hunters, in vain. then, he was attacked by an army composed of the best soldiers of the armies of the small states of italy and fled, defeated, in the water, which became the muddy and undrinkable water of the fonte drago ("wellspring [of the] dragon") oltre il colle.it is not the only monster in the area of oltre il colle: there is also a wicked maga ("sorceress" in italian) to threaten it.




ferocious beast

it was an enormous animal similar to a wolf. it ate pets and children and terrorized milan during the 1790s and the milanese organized a hunt against it. after months they killed the ferocious beast and displayed its body at the university of pavia. today it is no longer there and has been missing for decades. informal sources claim it was stolen, destroyed during ww2 or removed specifically by german actions during ww2.

[4]


other

egg of columbus

refers to a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact.  the expression refers to a popular story of how christopher columbus, having been told that discovering the americas was no great accomplishment, challenged his critics to make an egg stand on its tip.




striga

a demon or creature, derived from the corsican myth of the stegge. it is a witch or sentient beast of mammalian features, and like a woman, bat, dog and rat. it is not an omen but rather a bringer of harm and fear. it is said be a female thing that feeds on the blood and often parasites men and children. it is in a way, a type of bogy beast, like vampires in slavic mythologies and lore.

[5]


giufà

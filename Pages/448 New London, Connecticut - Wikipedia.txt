new london is a seaport city and a port of entry on the northeast coast of the united states, located at the mouth of the thames river in new london county, connecticut. it was one of the world's three busiest whaling ports for several decades beginning in the early 19th century, along with nantucket and new bedford, massachusetts. the wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city's present architecture. the city subsequently became home to other shipping and manufacturing industries, but it has gradually lost most of its industrial heart.
new london is home to the united states coast guard academy, connecticut college, mitchell college, and the williams school. the coast guard station new london and new london harbor is home port to the coast guard cutter chinook and the coast guard's tall ship eagle. the city had a population of 27,620 at the 2010 census.  the norwich-new london metropolitan area includes 21 towns and 274,055 people.

history[edit]
 fort trumbull, originally built on this site in 1777. the present structure was built between 1839 and 1852.

colonial era[edit]
the area was called nameaug by the pequot indians. john winthrop, jr. founded the first english settlement here in 1646, making it about the 13th town settled in connecticut. inhabitants informally referred to it as nameaug or as pequot after the tribe. in the 1650s, the colonists wanted to give the town the official name of london after london, england, but the connecticut general assembly wanted to name it faire harbour. the citizens protested, declaring that they would prefer it to be called nameaug if it couldn't be officially named london.[3][4] the legislature relented, and the town was officially named new london on march 10, 1658.

american revolution[edit]
the harbor was considered to be the best deep water harbor on long island sound,[5] and consequently new london became a base of american naval operations during the american revolutionary war. famous new londoners during the american revolution include nathan hale, william coit, richard douglass, thomas and nathaniel shaw, gen. samuel parsons, printer timothy green, and bishop samuel seabury.
new london was raided and much of it burned to the ground on september 6, 1781 in the battle of groton heights by norwich native benedict arnold in an attempt to destroy the revolutionary privateer fleet and supplies of goods and naval stores within the city. it is often noted that this raid on new london and groton was intended to divert general george washington and the french army under rochambeau from their march on yorktown, virginia. the main defensive fort for new london was fort griswold, located across the thames river in groton. it was well known to arnold, who sold its secrets to the british fleet so that they could avoid its artillery fire. the british overran new london's fort trumbull, while other soldiers moved in to attack ft. griswold across the river, commanded by lieutenant colonel william ledyard. the british suffered great casualties at ft. griswold before the americans were finally forced to surrender—whereupon the british stormed into and slaughtered most of the militia who defended it, including colonel ledyard. all told, more than 52 british soldiers and 83 militia were killed, and more than 142 british and 39 militia were wounded, many mortally. new london suffered over 6 militia killed and 24 wounded, while arnold and the british and hessian raiding party suffered an equal amount.[6]
connecticut's independent legislature made new london one of the first two cities brought from de facto to formalized incorporations in its january session of 1784, along with new haven.

19th century[edit]
during the war of 1812, torpedoes were employed in attempts to destroy british vessels and protect american harbors.  in fact, a submarine-deployed torpedo was used in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy hms ramillies while in new london's harbor.  this prompted british capt. hardy to warn the americans to cease efforts with the use of any "torpedo boat" in this "cruel and unheard-of warfare", or he would "order every house near the shore to be destroyed."[7]:693
for several decades beginning in the early 19th century, new london was one of the three busiest whaling ports in the world, along with nantucket and new bedford, massachusetts. the wealth that whaling brought into the city furnished the capital to fund much of the city's present architecture.
the new haven and new london railroad connected new london by rail to new haven and points beyond by the 1850s. the springfield and new london railroad connected new london to springfield, massachusetts by the 1870s.

military presence[edit]
several military installations have been part of new london's history, including the united states coast guard academy and coast guard station new london.[8] most of these military installations have been located at fort trumbull. the first fort trumbull was an earthwork built 1775-1777 that took part in the revolutionary war. the second fort trumbull was built 1839-1852 and still stands. by 1910, the fort's defensive function had been superseded by the new forts of the endicott program, primarily located on fishers island. the fort was turned over to the revenue cutter service and became the revenue cutter academy. the revenue cutter service was merged into the united states coast guard in 1915, and the academy relocated to its current site in 1932. during world war ii, the merchant marine officers training school was located at fort trumbull. from 1950 to 1990, fort trumbull was the location for the naval underwater sound laboratory, which developed sonar and related systems for us navy submarines. in 1990, the sound laboratory was merged with the naval underwater systems center in newport, rhode island, and the new london facility was closed in 1996.[9][10]
the naval submarine base new london is physically located in groton, but submarines were stationed in new london from 1951 to 1991. the submarine tender fulton and submarine squadron 10 were at state pier in new london during this time. squadron ten was usually composed of eight to ten submarines and was the first all-nuclear submarine squadron. in the 1990s, state pier was rebuilt as a container terminal.

geography[edit]
 49% of new london's area is water.
in terms of land area, new london is one of the smallest cities in connecticut. of the whole 10.76 square miles (27.9 km2), nearly half is water; 5.54 square miles (14.3 km2) is land.[11]
the town and city of new london are coextensive. sections of the original town were ceded to form newer towns between 1705 and 1801. the towns of groton, ledyard, montville, and waterford, and portions of salem and east lyme, now occupy what had earlier been the outlying area of new london.[12]
new london is bounded on the west and north by the town of waterford, on the east by the thames river and groton, and on the south by long island sound.

principal communities[edit]
downtown
ocean beach
other minor communities and geographic features are: bates woods park, fort trumbull, glenwood park, green's harbor beach, mitchell's woods, pequot colony, riverside park, old town mill.

towns created from new london[edit]
new london originally had a larger land area when it was established. towns set off since include:

stonington in 1649
this large area ran from the mystic river to the pawcatuck river, including pawcatuck, wequetequock, and the easterly half of mystic. it stretched inland from long island sound to lantern hill.
groton in 1705
ledyard (originally north groton) created from a part of groton in 1836
montville in 1786
salem created from parts of montville, colchester, and lyme in 1819
waterford in 1801
east lyme created from parts of waterford and lyme in 1839
fishers island officially left connecticut and became part of new york in 1879.
climate[edit]
new london is classified as having a temperate oceanic climate[13] and lies in the broad transition zone between continental climates (köppen climate classification: dfa) and temperate climates (köppen climate classification: cfa) as is typical for much of coastal connecticut. the city enjoys sunny weather, averaging 2,600 hours of sunshine annually.
in the summer months, the southerly flow from subtropical high pressure (the atlantic/bermuda high) often creates hot and humid weather. daytime heating produces occasional thunderstorms with heavy but brief downpours. spring and fall are mild in new london, with daytime highs in the 55 to 70 f range and lows in the 40 to 50 f range. the seaside geography allows a long growing season compared to areas inland. the first frost in the new london area is normally not until early november, almost three weeks later than parts of northern connecticut. winters are cool to cold with a mix of rainfall and snowfall, or mixed precipitation. new london normally sees fewer than 25 days annually with snow cover. in mid-winter, there can be large differences in low temperatures between areas along the coastline and areas well inland, often as much as 15 f.
tropical cyclones (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck connecticut and the new london metropolitan area, although infrequently. hurricane landfalls have occurred along the connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (carol), 1960 (donna), 1985 (gloria). tropical storm irene (2011) also caused moderate damage along the connecticut coast, as did hurricane sandy (which made landfall in new jersey) in 2012.
coastal connecticut (including new london) is the broad transition zone where so-called "subtropical indicator" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. new london averages about 90 days annually with freeze, about the same as baltimore, maryland. as such, southern magnolias, needle palms, windmill palm, loblolly pines, and crape myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. the growing season is quite long in new london, like much of coastal connecticut and long island, ny, averaging 210 days from april 8 to november 5.

the neighborhood of fort trumbull once consisted of nearly two-dozen homes, but they were seized by the city of new london using eminent domain. this measure was supported in the 2005 supreme court ruling of kelo v. city of new london, and the homes were ultimately demolished by the city as part of an economic development plan. the site was slated to be redeveloped under this plan, but the chosen developer was not able to get financing and the project failed. the empty landscape of the fort trumbull area has been characterized by some as an example of government overreach and inefficiency.[32][33][34][35]

history[edit]
for the history of aerospace sites outside of the city, e.g., white sands space harbor, see white sands missile range and holloman air force base.
tularosa basin has been inhabited for at least 11,000 years. there are signs of previous inhabitants in the area such as the clovis culture, the folsom culture, the peoples of the archaic period, and the formative stage.[9]
the mescalero apache were already living in the tularosa basin when the spanish came in 1534, and mescalero oral history says they have always lived there.[10]
the spanish built a chapel at la luz (about 5 miles (8.0 km) from the future site of alamogordo) in 1719, although la luz was not settled until about 1860.[11][12]:167
the city of alamogordo was founded in june 1898, when the el paso and northeastern railroad, headed by charles bishop eddy, extended the railway to the town.[13]:4, 6–7 eddy influenced the design of the community, which included large wide thoroughfares and tree-lined irrigation canals.[14] charles eddy's brother, john arthur eddy, named the new city alamogordo ("large/fat cottonwood"[15] in spanish) after a grove of fat cottonwoods he remembered from the pecos river area.[13]:x–1 when alamogordo was laid out in 1898, the east-west streets were given numerical designations, while north-south streets were named after states. the present-day white sands boulevard was then called pennsylvania avenue.[12]:42, 44–45
several government buildings in alamogordo were constructed by the works progress administration, a government program created in 1935 in response to the great depression. these include the otero county administration building at 1101 new york avenue, a pueblo style building originally constructed as the main u.s. post office in 1938. the building is listed in the national register of historic places. the main entrance portico features frescoes by peter hurd completed in 1942. the post office moved out in 1961, and the building was used by a succession of federal agencies and was known as the federal building. the last federal agency to occupy it was the united states forest service who used it as the headquarters of the lincoln national forest until october 2008, when that agency moved to a newly constructed building.[16][17]
ownership of the building was transferred to otero county government and many government offices were moved from the courthouse to the new administration building in february 2009.[18][19] alamogordo briefly made international news in late 2001 when christ community church held a public book burning of books in the harry potter series, and several other series, on december 30.[20][21][22]

geography[edit]
as of 2010, alamogordo had a total area of 19.3 square miles (50.0 km2), all of it land.[23] the city is located at an elevation of 4,336 feet (1,322 m)[3] on the western flank of the sacramento mountains and on the eastern edge of the tularosa basin. it lies within the rio grande rift[24] and in the northernmost part of the chihuahuan desert.[25]:36 tectonic activity is low in the tularosa basin.[26] plants native to the area are typical of the southern new mexico foothills and include creosote bush, mesquite, saltbush, cottonwood, desert willow, and many species of cactus and yucca.[27]
the tularosa basin is an endorheic, or closed, basin; that is, no water flows out of it.[26][28]
because of this and because of the geology of the region, water in the basin is hard: it has very high total dissolved solids concentrations, in excess of 3,000 mg/l.[26][29]
the brackish groundwater national desalination research facility, a bureau of reclamation laboratory doing research and development on desalination of brackish water, is located in alamogordo.[30]
the gypsum crystals of white sands national monument are formed in lake lucero. water drains from the mountains carrying dissolved gypsum and collects in lake lucero. after the water dries, the winds pick up the gypsum crystals and distribute them over the basin.[25]:37

alamogordo is the economic center of otero county,[38] with nearly half the otero county population living within the city limits. alamogordo today has very little manufacturing and has a primarily service and retail economy, driven by tourism, a large nearby military installation and a concentration of military retirees.[39][40] in 2006 the per capita income in otero county was $22,377 versus per capita income in new mexico of $29,346.[41]

economic history[edit]
alamogordo was founded as a company town to support the building of the el paso and northeastern railroad,[13]:2
a portion of the transcontinental railway that was being constructed in the late 19th century. initially its main industry was timbering for railroad ties.[13]:1 the railroad founders were also eager to found a major town that would persist after the railroad was completed; they formed the alamogordo improvement company to develop the area,[13]:5 making alamogordo an early example of a planned community. the alamogordo improvement company owned all the land, platted the streets, built the first houses and commercial buildings, donated land for a college, and placed a restrictive covenant on each deed prohibiting the manufacture, distribution, or sale of intoxicating liquor.[13]:1,9,13,44
tourism became an important part of the local economy from the creation of white sands national monument in 1934.[13]:53 construction began on the alamogordo army air field (the present-day holloman air force base) in 1942, and the federal government has been a strong presence in alamogordo ever since.[13]:39,53 education has also been an important part of the local economy. in addition to the local school system, alamogordo is home to the new mexico school for the blind and visually impaired, founded in 1903, and a branch of new mexico state university founded in 1958.[13]:44,58  the largest non-government employer in the city is the gerald champion regional medical center with 650 employees in 2008.[42]

military impact[edit]
holloman air force base, located approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) west of the city limits, is the largest employer of alamogordo residents, and has a major effect on the local economy. according to some estimates, holloman accounts for half of the alamogordo economy.[43][44]
according to the 49th fighter wing public affairs office, as of january 2008 holloman directly employs 6,111 personnel with a gross payroll of $266 million. it indirectly creates another 2,047 jobs with a payroll of $77 million. the estimated amount spent in the community, including payroll, construction projects, supplies, services, health care, and education, is $482 million.[45]

 the first f-22 raptor assigned to holloman afb arrives on june 2, 2008
an estimated 6,700 military retirees live in the area. counting both usaf and german air force personnel there are 1,383 active military and 1,641 military dependents living on base and 2,765 active military and 2,942 military dependents living off base.[45]
future combat systems is a wide-ranging modernization project of the us army. much of the work will be done at fort bliss, with some at white sands missile range and some at holloman air force base. alamogordo is expected to get some economic benefit due to its proximity to these three bases.[46]

economic development[edit]
otero county economic development council is a nonprofit organization founded in 1984. its focus has generally been on job creation and recruiting and expanding businesses in otero county, including helping them satisfy business regulations in new mexico and lining up funding.[47][48]
its role expanded in 2000, when alamogordo passed an economic development gross receipts tax. ocedc continues to work to attract businesses, but now it also helps develop the incentive packages that will be paid by the new tax, and a portion of the tax receipts go to fund ocedc's operating expenses.[49]
formal economic development plans have been adopted by alamogordo[50]
and by otero county.[51]
ocedc has recruited several new employers by using financial incentives. a 1-800-flowers call center opened in november 2001 and received $1.25 million in city rent abatements, a 50% reduction in property taxes from otero county, and $940,000 in plant training funds from the state of new mexico.[52][53]
a sunbaked biscuits cookie factory opened in 2006 and received $800,000 in job-training incentives from the state.[54]
when the company went out of business in 2007, marietta baking took over the cookie factory and received interest-free loans, job-training incentives, and partial forgiveness of indebtedness for job creation.[55][56]
a branch office of precheck inc., a company performing background checks of health-care workers, opened in 2006. precheck received $2.4 million in high-wage job creation tax credits, $1.5 million in job-training subsidies, $1.5 million in capital outlay money for roads and infrastructure, a $625,000 allocation from city of alamogordo for upgrading sewer lines in the area, and 20.8 aces of land from heritage group, a developer.[57]

 new buildings in alamogordo: precheck, inc. headquarters, aviator 10 theater, and the us department of agriculture / forest service building.
the otero county film office,[58]
an office of otero county economic development council, promotes film-making in otero county by publicizing potential locations in the county and new mexico's film financial incentive programs[59] and by recruiting extras for film productions. it sponsors the desert light film competition for middle and high school students to encourage learning about the film industry.[60]
the 2007 film transformers spent $5.5 million in new mexico and $1 million in alamogordo.[61]

 japanese propaganda posted of the shōwa era showing adolf hitler, fumimaro konoe and benito mussolini, the political leaders of the three main axis powers in 1938
the axis leaders of world war ii were important political and military figures during world war ii. the axis was established with the signing of the tripartite pact in 1940 and pursued a strongly militarist and nationalist ideology; with a policy of anti-communism. during the early phase of the war, puppet governments were established in their occupied nations. when the war ended, many of them faced trial for war crimes. the chief leaders were adolf hitler of germany, benito mussolini of italy and emperor hirohito of japan. unlike what happened with the allies, there was never a joint meeting of the main axis heads of government, although mussolini and adolf hitler did meet on a regular basis.

benito mussolini was prime minister of the kingdom of italy from 1922 until 1943. the founder of fascism, mussolini made italy the first fascist state, using the ideas of nationalism, militarism, anti-communism and anti-socialism combined with state propaganda. in 1925, he assumed dictatorial powers as the duce ("leader") of fascism, and was subsequently called duce by his fascist supporters. from 1925, king victor emmanuel iii delegated his powers to mussolini and opposition to mussolini and the fascist state was seen as treason. though his regime influenced adolf hitler and nazi germany, mussolini did not subscribe to nazi racial theories, dismissing them as mythical and fabricated. only in 1938, under increased pressure from hitler, did he adopt anti-semitism as a state policy, and opposed the deportation of jews by the germans from italian territory. mussolini was the official head of the milizia volontaria per la sicurezza nazionale, mvsn ("volunteer militia for national security"), often called the "blackshirts", who were fascist partisans loyal specifically to him, rather than the king. successive military defeats from 1941, culminating in the battle of el alamein in 1942 and the allied invasion of sicily in july 1943, led to mussolini and his government's dissolution and dismissal by the king. arrested on the orders of the king, mussolini was rescued by the germans and became the puppet head of state of the italian social republic (regime under control of nazi germany) in northern italy. mussolini was executed by italian partisans on 28 april 1945, while attempting to flee to spain.
